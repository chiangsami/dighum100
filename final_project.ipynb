      "This story contains offensive language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TV meteorologist Chris Gloninger didn't just want to warn people about the latest record-breaking storm — he wanted to talk about the changing climate behind it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have been able to draw ever-clearer connections between climate change and extreme weather events, and Gloninger believes weather forecasts should explain that to viewers. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I truly believe it is the existential crisis of our lifetime,\" he says. \"And that's why I think it's so important to do it.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger — the chief meteorologist for CBS affiliate KCCI-TV in Des Moines, Iowa — has brought that mindset to seven television stations across five states during his 18-year career, earning him both praise and pushback. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, he's pivoting. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger announced on Wednesday that he is \"bidding farewell to TV to embark on a new journey dedicated to helping solve the climate crisis.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons, he said, were \"a death threat stemming from my climate coverage last year and resulting PTSD, in addition to family health issues.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger received a steady stream of threatening and harassing emails from one individual starting last summer, as he shared on Twitter at the time. A 63-year-old Iowa man pleaded guilty to third-degree harassment several months later. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My #climate coverage has garnered negative feedback. But last month I received the first threat, followed by a flow of harassing emails. Police are investigating. It’s mentally exhausting & at times I have NOT been ok. If you’re facing this & need someone to talk to, I’m here. 1/ pic.twitter.com/SGbZfEr1uT\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The vast majority of Americans accept climate change as fact — a national study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication released earlier this month found that 74% agree global warming is happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's just that those dismissive of climate change, Gloninger says, can be the loudest. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It wasn't so much necessarily just the threat, but in this case, this person sent obsessive emails after that threat over and over and over and over again,\" he adds. \"And it just kind of wears on you, it beats you down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger told NPR over Zoom that he'd long planned to find a more \"hands-on approach\" to tackling the climate crisis full-time, beyond weaving it into weathercasts. Coping with the threats, on top of caring for aging parents, just sped up that process. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next month he'll start a new job at the Woods Hole Group, an environmental consulting organization in Massachusetts. Gloninger says he's excited to use his scientific background and communication skills to help communities deal with climate change, like he's aimed to do all along. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not giving up,\" he says. \"I'm just switching roles to do even more of it.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger believes it's the job of meteorologists to keep people safe, and that interrupting regularly scheduled programming with a breaking weather alert is just one way they can do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've always advocated that that responsibility continues when we're outside of severe weather, because climate change is affecting all aspects of life, and it is a risk to human health and safety,\" he adds.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He says it's not about mentioning climate change in every weathercast, but making the connection clear when there is one. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, when Canadian wildfires brought dangerous smoke to parts of the U.S., he saw an opportunity to address why such blazes are becoming more intense in the first place.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are also other creative ways to talk about it and talk about the solutions side of it,\" Gloninger says, adding that Iowa's status as a national leader in wind energy could open the door to a discussion about fossil fuel alternatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger isn't the only meteorologist who thinks so. He's quick to give credit to retired South Carolina meteorologist Jim Gandy, whom he says \"got the ball rolling\" by launching the \"Climate Matters\" program in 2010. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he's noticed more and more meteorologists starting to connect the dots over the last decade, even as climate change has become increasingly politicized. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd say there are more that talk about it than don't, which is quite remarkable,\" Gloninger says. \"And I'm just so proud of my colleagues that have really embraced it and continued to work through the pushback.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger had dreamed of being a meteorologist since elementary school, when he saw the damage that Hurricane Bob wrought on his native Long Island and became \"amazed by the power of Mother Nature.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As his career progressed, so did his concerns about the climate crisis. He started mentioning it on air, as he covered record-breaking storms from Albany and, later, Boston. Hurricane Harvey, in 2017, made him want to do even more. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When a region gets 60 inches of rain, I think you have to step back and be like, 'Well, we broke these records that have been in place for decades, by such a wide margin. What is going on?'\" he says. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger launched Boston's first weekly climate change series, which ran for two years and won a regional Emmy in 2019. And he got plenty of criticism during that time, even in what many people assume is liberal-leaning Massachusetts. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The pushback, he explains, wasn't new to Iowa — but that's where it reached a breaking point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger started getting troubling emails in June 2022. He responded to the first one to try to engage the sender in a productive discussion, but says things \"kind of went off the rails\" after that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sender, whom authorities have since identified as Danny Hancock, sent more emails, including one referring to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh: \"What's your address, we conservative Iowans would like to give you an Iowan welcome you will never forget, kinda like the libtards gave JUDGE KAVANAUGH!!!!!!!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier that same month, a California man who had made threats against Kavanaugh was arrested near the justice's home with a gun, zip ties and other gear. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger reported the email to police, who investigated as more threats continued to flood his inbox (Hancock admitted to sending them when he was contacted by police in August). He says the whole ordeal was \"mentally exhausting\" and resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He has also been caring for his parents and in-laws, who are dealing with health issues. All of that, he says, pushed him to take a step back and reevaluate his journey. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just like there are so many punches you can take,\" Gloninger says. \"Let's just try to hit a reset button.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gloninger wants to make clear that the issue was a specific string of threats by one person — and as his story picks up national attention, he doesn't want Iowans in general to get a bad rap. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think in all of this, what hurts me the most is when I see people making disparaging comments about where I currently am located,\" he says. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, Gloninger says, the vast majority of people he's met there over the last two years have been exceptionally kind and encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One example: He received hundreds of supportive emails in the days after announcing his departure, and printed them out into a manuscript-sized stack. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've never heard back from that many people, people that like the job that journalists are doing, telling important stories, meteorologists connecting the dots between climate change and extreme weather,\" he says.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Gloninger prepares to leave the industry, he says it's more important than ever for journalists to cover climate change deeply and push for accountability, \"because that's what people deserve.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he says people don't have to change careers like he did in order to make the world a better place — they just need to practice being a bit kinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Climate change isn't an opinion, it's fact-based science. But at the same point, if your ideas differ from somebody else's, just be kind. Don't go on the offensive and attack,\" he says. \"We can live life with more love, kindness and compassion ... and we can all become better in that.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas, and is the second-largest contributor to climate warming after carbon dioxide (CO2). A molecule of methane traps more heat than a molecule of CO2, but methane has a relatively short lifespan of 7 to 12 years in the atmosphere, while CO2 can persist for hundreds of years or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Methane comes from both natural sources and human activities. An estimated 60% of today’s methane emissions are the result of human activities. The largest sources of methane are agriculture, fossil fuels, and decomposition of landfill waste. Natural processes account for 40% of methane emissions, with wetlands being the largest natural source. (Learn more about the Global Methane Budget.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The concentration of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled over the past 200 years. Scientists estimate that this increase is responsible for 20 to 30% of climate warming since the Industrial Revolution (which began in 1750).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it’s relatively simple to measure the amount of methane in the atmosphere, it’s harder to pinpoint where it’s coming from. NASA scientists are using several methods to track methane emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One tool that NASA uses is the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation, or AVIRIS-NG. This instrument, which gets mounted onto research planes, measures light that is reflected off Earth’s surface. Methane absorbs some of this reflected light. By measuring the exact wavelengths of light that are absorbed, the AVIRIS-NG instrument can determine the amount of greenhouse gases present.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA added the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument to the International Space Station in 2022. Though built principally to study dust storms and sources, researchers found that it could also detect large methane sources, known as “super-emitters.”\n",

      "These aircraft and satellite instruments are finding methane rising from oil and gas production, pipelines, refineries, landfills, and animal agriculture. In some cases, these measurements have led to leaks being fixed, including suburban gas leaks and faulty equipment in oil and gas fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arctic is a source of natural methane from wetlands, lakes, and thawing permafrost. Although a warming climate could change these emissions, scientists do not yet think it will drive a major increase. To this end, NASA’s Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment, or ABoVE, has been measuring methane coming from natural sources like thawing permafrost in Alaska and Canada.\n",

      "\n",
      "According to the National Park Service 85% of wildfires in the United States are started by humans, sometimes these are intentional but most often by accident. Canada says about half of their fires this year have been started by humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However. the conditions that make wildfires more intense and severe, including heat and drought, are strongly linked to human-induced changes in the climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada's natural resources agency says climate change could potentially double the amount of area burned by the end of this century with potential economic consequences like lack of timber supply and changes in which tree species make up the majority of forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Damaged trees, dead trees, brush in the forests attributed to drought or invasive insects can also increase the amount of fuel for forest fires.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is preliminary research that shows rising global temperatures can affect the jet stream’s flow making it weaker and therefore allowing air to sit stagnant for longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The jetstream exists, because there is a large difference in temperature between the poles and the equator. The jet is stronger in the northern hemisphere in winter because the temperature gradient is bigger. In summer, the jet is weaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we see global temperatures rising overall, but the arctic and poles are warming 2-3 times faster than anywhere else. That means there is less temperature difference and scientists believe this may cause the jet to be weaker in all seasons.\n",

      "\n",
      "The National Stakeholders Consultation concluded all the provincial consultations from late 2022 to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Provincial consultations included consultation and receiving feedback from Provincial Governments, Civil Society Organisations, Faith Based Organisations, Chiefs, Women, and Youth and Community representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Views collected during the consultation have been incorporated into the draft policy which is used in the National Stakeholder Consultation,in preparation for the Policy validation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the opening of theNational Stakeholders Consultation, Supervising Permanent Secretary for the MECDM Mr Karl Kuper said, like many other nations Solomon Islands find itself on the frontlines of climate change impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events resulting in the loss of habitat and biodiversity threatening our communities, our ecosystems, and our very own way of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, on a brighter note, Mr Kuper said, amidst all these challenges lies opportunities – opportunities for the country to come together to forge partnerships and chart a pathway towards a more sustainable and resilient future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Solomon Islands launched its first Climate Change Policy in 2012 which covers a period of 5 years up to 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That document has been the guide for all climate change work in the country and recognises climate change as a sustainable development issue that brings opportunities as well as challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Building upon that idea the Government will through the revised policy aim to enhance the country’s adaptive policy while pursuing a path of low-carbon development.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Kuper added that in this review the government is building on the previous policy and more importantly emerging issues on climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The new policy must align itself to national, regional, and international climate change initiatives, strategies, and policies but with a focus on implementation. More so it foresees a progressively resilient, safe, and secure Solomon Islands from climate change impacts and climate-induced disasters with a focus on delivering low carbon pathways for the country by 2050”\n",

      "Jeff Gray arrives home on a late Tuesday afternoon as the temperature outside hovers around 90 degrees, hotter than average for early June. After entering, he sits in a chair positioned directly in front of an air conditioner blowing cool air into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gray has lived in his two-story brick home near Cherokee Street for more than 20 years. He grew up in the infamous Pruitt-Igoe projects and eventually moved into his current house, where he raised his kids. They’re now grown up and moved out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He keeps the doors to his second floor shut and doesn’t open his first-floor windows because of crime in the area. Plastic sheeting lines the windows year-round to trap in the heat during the winter and cool air during the summer. As in most of St. Louis’ historic brick houses, the sweltering summer heat and humidity amplify and stay around longer without proper insulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gray had old air conditioning units that he used for years, but despite his efforts to fix them up, after last summer, they were shot.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I was getting really kind of stressed because it is getting humid,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gray has been on disability since 1993 after a tragedy took his left eye and glaucoma started overcoming his right. He called EnergyCare, one of the local nonprofits that provides energy-related assistance to low-income people struggling with extreme temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, EnergyCare helped Gray winterize his home and pay for energy bills during hard times. In late May, it installed two new air conditioners on his first floor — one in his living room and another in his bedroom.\n",

      "The urban heat island effect and the legacy of redlining — namely an abundance of hard, dark surfaces and absence of green spaces as a result of disinvestment — have also left predominantly Black neighborhoods in St. Louis several degrees hotter than their surrounding areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although St. Louis won’t experience much in the way of sea level rise, hurricanes or wildfires due to its landlocked Midwestern location, the region is far from immune to other climate impacts.\n",

      "The City of St. Louis — with its first-ever sustainability director, Catherine Werner, at the helm — published its Climate Vulnerability Assessment in 2018 to evaluate the climate-change hazards most likely to impact the city and map the most vulnerable populations. Extreme heat was found to be the region’s top climate hazard, alongside extreme cold, tornadoes, drought and flooding.\n",
      "\n",

      "Temperatures in Missouri have risen nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit since the beginning of the 1900s, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Anthony Lupo, Missouri’s interim state climatologist, says the greatest increase in average temperature has been observed in winter, followed by spring and fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The average summer temperature has seen the most modest increase. Summer, however, has experienced the biggest increase in average dew point temperature, which refers to the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. When combined with the air temperature, the dew point gives you the “feels like” temperature, or heat index.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lupo says that this part of the country could have a greater number of uncomfortable heat index days, putting the people who are most vulnerable — including older and poorer populations — at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A study published last summer — based on a moderate emissions scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2040 — found that St. Louis will be among the five metro areas most impacted by an “extreme heat belt” projected to emerge across the central U.S. in the next 30 years. This belt shows that much of the industrial Midwest, deprived of the relief brought by coastal breezes, has the biggest risk for “extreme danger days,” or days with a heat index of 125 degrees or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It also found that in Missouri, St. Louis County will experience the largest increase in “local hot days,” projected to go from seven days over 108 degrees in 2022 to 21 days in 30 years. The city will similarly experience 21 days over 107 degrees in 30 years.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the daytime, your body is programmed to put up with heat, but your body expects at night to be able to cool off,” Lupo says. “So it’s the increase in nighttime temperatures that presents the biggest danger.”\n",

      "'The silent killer'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heat already kills more people in the United States than any other climate-related hazard. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 702 heat-related deaths and 9,235 heat-related hospitalizations occur annually. Many surmise that these are significantly underreported because of the oversight or misclassification of heat-related illnesses and deaths in medical records. A 2021 study estimated that heat led to around 12,000 premature deaths in the U.S. during the 2010s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In Missouri, there were 4,377 reported cases of hyperthermia — the term for heat-related illness — between 1980 and 2016, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Of these cases, 1,272 were deaths. The City of St. Louis saw the greatest share of deaths at 31.7%, followed by Jackson County and St. Louis County. One heat wave in late June and early July 2012 alone killed 18 people in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heat deaths don’t have the drama of tornado deaths or hurricane deaths or flooding deaths. So it’s often referred to as the silent killer of climate change,” says Andrew Hurley, a historian at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who researches climate change and urban development.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Its effects are cumulative and gradually take a toll on the human body. Heat is also often a secondary cause of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you do have people that die of heat stroke, which comes on after prolonged exposure, but then you also have people with underlying conditions who are vulnerable to begin with. So they may suffer death from heart attack that is exacerbated by the stress on the body when the temperature goes up. Those aren’t recorded as heat deaths, but they’re very real,” Hurley says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, heat-related illness and deaths have declined dramatically across the country and in Missouri in recent decades, in large part due to the proliferation of air conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s probably the most dramatic historical change in how urban populations have adapted to hot weather,” Hurley says. According to U.S. census data from 2011, more than 90% of housing units in St. Louis have central air conditioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hurley thinks disparities in terms of people’s ability to survive extremely hot weather have grown alongside air conditioning. He says that before air conditioning became commonplace, people sought refuge from the heat outside, often in collective green spaces like parks. Now, they stay indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The positive result has been fewer heat-related deaths, but the negative has been the loss of social interaction provided by people congregating in green spaces. And air conditioning has a much worse environmental impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more, Hurley says, air conditioning varies in quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we often find in terms of people who have died in recent heat waves is they’ve had air conditioning,” he says. But their air conditioning was old and not working well, or they were worried about their electric bills so they didn’t turn it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor people, and people of color who tend to be poorer, were always more vulnerable to heat across time,” Hurley says. “But I think it’s intensified since the era of air conditioning.”\n",

      "\n",
      "A legacy of redlining\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, researchers have started looking at the link between redlining policies in cities across the U.S. and the disparate impacts of urban extreme heat today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice of refusing home loans or insurance in neighborhoods deemed “hazardous” based on race or ethnicity, which was outlawed by the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivek Shandas, a professor of geography at Portland State University, co-authored a study published in 2020 that looks at whether those decades of disinvestment in communities of color have led to a current-day experience of higher temperatures in neighborhoods in 108 cities, including St. Louis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was pretty remarkable what we found,” Shandas says. The analysis showed that formerly redlined areas were on average about 5 degrees hotter than their non-redlined counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the city of St. Louis, the temperature difference was of 4.7 degrees, “which is higher than many of the cities that we’ve seen, and it was a very clear signal that St. Louis has actually got areas that have much, much hotter redlined neighborhoods today, even though redlining is no longer part of our official federal policy,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They also found that the redlined areas — which include north city and some parts of south city to the east of Tower Grove Park — lacked tree canopy and were replete with impervious surfaces like concrete and asphalt, as well as “land-hungry development” made of dense materials that absorb and re-emit heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "EnergyCare also conducted its own analysis in 2020. In partnership with data scientists at Washington University, the nonprofit looked at where its clients live and how their energy burden — that is, their income divided by utility costs — affects their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis found that most of EnergyCare’s clients live in the parts of St. Louis “where decades of redlining, disinvestment and racial injustice have produced communities where people struggle to stay warm in their own homes in the winter and cool in the summer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "More specifically, Executive Director Tim O’Dea says, the requests come from north St. Louis and parts of south St. Louis such as Gravois Park, Benton Park East and Dutchtown. More and more requests are coming from St. Louis County in the older, inner-ring suburbs such as Jennings and Wellston.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gentry Trotter of Cool Down St. Louis — another St. Louis-based nonprofit that provides energy-related assistance to vulnerable people in 44 counties across Missouri and Illinois — says it helps people most in north St. Louis and a strip of south St. Louis in addition to parts of north county, East St. Louis and St. Charles County near Blanchette Memorial Bridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the nonprofit’s clients live in older homes where deferred maintenance has compounded their energy burden, making utility bills all the more difficult to pay and disconnections more likely to occur. And both O’Dea and Trotter say the urban heat island effect, which leaves cities significantly hotter than their outlying regions due to the abundance of heat-trapping pavement and buildings and the lack of greenery providing cooling shade and evaporation, impacts their clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate Central, a nonprofit that researches the impacts of climate change around the world, included St. Louis in its 2021 analysis of the urban heat island effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "St. Louis ranked 22 out of the 158 cities evaluated for urban heat island intensity, says Manager of Analysis and Production Jennifer Brady, with the effect making the city around 7 degrees hotter on average than its surrounding areas. The main factor contributing to this stark difference: a low “albedo” score due to the abundance of dark and impermeable surfaces absorbing and retaining the sun’s heat rather than reflecting it. The urban heat island effect, she says, is expected to get worse with climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate Central ranks St. Louis as one of its top 10 cities for impermeable surfaces, with a remarkable 57% of the city being hard, dry surfaces like buildings, roads and parking lots that contribute to higher temperatures. Brady says that many of the older buildings in Midwestern cities were designed to keep heat in during the winter, which requires a lot of retrofitting to fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the analysis only looked at the average for entire cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We know some neighborhoods are much worse than other neighborhoods, there’s no denying it,” Brady says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She points to recent NOAA efforts that were spearheaded by Shandas. Since 2017, NOAA has been organizing campaigns in cities across the country to map the urban heat island effect on a more granular level. Kansas City and Columbia have participated, but St. Louis has yet to follow suit.\n",

      "Varied solutions, varied progress\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DeSoto Park was initially developed to serve the residents of the Pruitt-Igoe and Vaughn projects. Now it serves Carr Square and its adjacent north city neighborhoods — and it’s been the focus of a campaign to increase trees in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign comes from nonprofit Forest ReLeaf, which is making some headway, says Rebecca Hankins. She walks along a path flanking the park’s soccer fields, passionately showing where river birches planted in 2017 are growing and will eventually provide shade for players and spectators using the fields. In December 2021, Forest ReLeaf worked with community members to plant an additional 60 trees of eight different species in the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The nonprofit has been working with community groups and supporting municipalities to expand native tree growth on public land across Missouri for 30 years. Hankins was brought on board as the partnership’s manager in 2021 to boost its capacity to increase the city’s tree canopy, especially in north city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "St. Louis neighborhoods tend to have a lower Tree Equity Score, which indicates whether they have enough trees for residents to reap the benefits. In the past two to three years, Hankins says the nonprofit has planted and been actively stewarding more than 750 trees in north city alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t realize how much trees are doing for us,” she says. They’re a cost-effective solution for so many issues, she says, like reducing asthma-causing air pollutants, managing stormwater and mitigating urban heat. Through shade and evapotranspiration, trees can cool communities by several degrees and provide a respite during periods of extreme heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heat from the sun’s rays builds up on gray infrastructure during the day and radiates back out at night even after the sun goes down, Hankins says. Trees block those harmful rays.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The leaves are absorbing all of that heat and energy, and they’re converting it into something magnificent,” she says. “They’re turning that into energy for the tree to grow, which puts out oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But otherwise, that energy from the sun is just lost on concrete,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearby, Forest ReLeaf’s canopy crew is watering a diverse mix of around 30 recently planted trees — including tulip trees recognizable by their distinct leaves shaped like a cat’s face — along Gateway Elementary School to build a more resilient tree canopy. Just before, the crew was watering around 50 trees planted earlier this spring at Yeatman Square Park in the JeffVanderLou neighborhood and replanting a bald cypress that had been run over by a lawnmower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forest ReLeaf has recognized that if we really want to make an impact, we can’t just plant a tree and walk away. We have to steward that tree to the point it’s going to survive on its own,” Hankins says. A tree is most vulnerable during its first three years of establishment, she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The new trees replaced the former ash trees at both locations that had been ravaged by the emerald ash borer. The metallic green-winged beetles have been migrating across the U.S. over the past 20 years, Hankins says, leaving dead ash trees in their wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re losing trees at an alarming rate because of the emerald ash borer,” she says. More than 3,150 street trees have been removed in the past three years. Another 8,600 still need to come down, many in north city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Urban tree cover averages around 40% nationally, according to a 2018 study. In 2010, Forest ReLeaf assessed the urban tree cover in St. Louis at 18.2% of the city, with the possibility of 33.9% tree cover. (City officials did not have the current percentage.) The emerald ash borer and other conditions, like the recent drought, have made it difficult to merely maintain the level of tree canopy in the city, let alone increase it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "St. Louis Forestry Commissioner Alan Jankowski says more ash is dying than in previous years, which is straining resources. The Forestry Division has been down staff since COVID-19, he says. To keep up with the workload, the city has a half-million-dollar contract with a private company that helps take down ash trees and another million-dollar contract to help take down other hazard trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Come fall, the Forestry Division will set about planting its annual goal of 3,000 trees. It applied for an Inflation Reduction Act grant that the city hopes will allow it to double those numbers this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It takes decades to build that canopy, and it starts now,” Jankowski says. “We’re really planting for the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Priority is given to the low-canopy, disadvantaged communities in the city, he says, but it’s ultimately up to the city’s aldermen to allocate funds for their wards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Planting trees, however, can’t be the only solution to reducing extreme heat in St. Louis. Before the 2018 Climate Vulnerability Assessment, Werner — the city’s former sustainability director and now a senior sustainability planner with engineering consultants AECOM — developed the city’s first Climate Action & Adaptation Plan in 2017 to identify the recommended climate mitigation and adaptation efforts in St. Louis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to increasing the city’s tree canopy, the report identified installing cool and vegetative roofs as actions to cool the city. In 2013, a few years prior to the report’s publication, the city awarded a grant to a pilot project in the Forest Park Southeast Neighborhood called Painting Sustainability, which trained residents and volunteers to paint roofs with a reflective white coating that lowered rooftop temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, however, there is little evidence that the city has installed any cool or green roofs on public buildings or that it is financially incentivizing residents and businesses to install the roofs themselves. A city spokesman wasn’t able to provide information on any more recent programs before publication. (The city’s 2013 Sustainable Neighborhood Toolkit does include instructions on how members of the community can create their own cool roofs program.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Planting trees and installing cool or green roofs fall into what Shandas describes as the “physical” category of solutions to urban extreme heat, in which municipalities try to change the physical design or experience of a city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another category is “social” solutions, which encompass more than 100 cooling centers in the St. Louis region, many of which are at public libraries and nonprofits, and the services provided by the likes of EnergyCare and Cool Down St. Louis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Policy” is Shandas’ last category — and often the slowest to gain traction, he says, because policymakers are struggling to grapple with heat, given that it doesn’t fall squarely into any one agency. Some cities, like Miami, have created the position of “chief heat officer” in their governments to help coordinate across multiple bureaus. St. Louis hasn’t done that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In St. Louis and across the country, Werner says in an email, a “lack of information, limited capacity and constrained financial resources are always a challenge.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The interesting aspect of AI is that it applies to so many things we do, including tasks that were previously activities only humans could accomplish. Climate change is one of the most difficult scientific problems that humans have ever faced. It's a phenomenally complex system with an enormous number of variables. When people talk about climate change, they tend to focus on the physical aspects of climate, such as the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, temperatures, precipitation levels, and wind patterns. But these characteristics are all shaped by a living planet that is constantly changing. If you took life off planet Earth, it would have a very different environment.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another use for AI is helping to reduce the carbon that is released into the atmosphere, and AI feeds into the entire chain of activities related to transitioning from a carbon-based economy to a net carbon zero economy. The ability to build larger and larger windmills depends on having materials that are exceptionally light and extraordinarily strong but that can sustain extreme weather conditions. We're beginning to learn how to use AI to assist us in the design and creation of those materials.\n",

      "AI in combination with other trends, such as the electrification of transportation, additive manufacturing, transformations in agriculture, and smart electrical grids, is a powerful enabling capability for more energy efficient (and cost saving) solutions.

      "Artificial intelligence combines predictions based on trends and patterns with the extensive data collected. Models are at the core of prediction, but to rely on these models to make decisions, people must trust the models. Scientists are asking \"what if\" questions, and policymakers are weighing costs and benefits based on data collected and analyzed by researchers. AI is one tool that provides insights into where uncertainties come from related to climate change and that can help us understand what the models are telling us, which can feed back into better observation programs, improving the models, and even using AI as part of the model system. Assurance, or trust, is a key aspect of using AI.\n",

      "My work, which focuses on better understanding oceans, along with the work my colleagues at APL are doing in space, have very tangible applications and outcomes. The ocean is one of the least understood parts of the Earth, as it both transfers and absorbs heat. We don't know exactly how the ocean responds to various environmental changes, and we also don't know specifically how climate change is impacting our oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another application of AI to climate change is how satellites orbiting in space are used to make observations and assess changes to the Earth. Satellites can help monitor forest fires and determine potential sources of carbon dioxide that are found in the environment. However, as the number of satellites in orbit increases, it's important to make sure that space can safely hold and maintain all the satellites collecting information.\n",

      "For example, the Arctic is changing rapidly and dramatically, with increasing temperatures being regularly documented. During spring, summer, and fall, ships in the Arctic collect data and other essential information that is used by scientists and policymakers. But in the winter, ice conditions in that region make it challenging for ship operations, so the ships depart, creating a significant observation and data collection gap. Using AI-powered robots in this scenario allows information to continue to be accumulated with the technology providing predictions based on trends and patterns. This would allow information to continue to be accumulated, with the technology providing predictions based on trends and patterns.\n",

      "We would like robots to be able to operate on their own for up to six months in the Arctic Basin to make observations and then provide us with that data. Part of it is filling in the observation system, and another part of it is combining these various cues and allowing AI to help us see patterns we recognize in larger data sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the challenges we have in really understanding climate is to begin to truly comprehend the complexities of the living part of our ecosystem, particularly our oceans. The oceans present a number of difficulties, including the fact that it is prohibitively expensive to deploy and maintain the number of ships we need to observe the ocean and collect needed data. Robots are being increasingly used for this purpose, but their autonomous capabilities need to be improved. This is where AI comes into play.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The additional oversight and prediction that AI provides to researchers is valuable, but there are expenses that need to be considered to assess the true benefits in terms of climate change work. One example is that AI relies on computers, and computers need electrical power to function, and electricity uses resources. Scientists and researchers must keep the use of electricity that is used to power AI technology in mind when assessing how beneficial the technology is in addressing climate change. On average, each new generation of processor carries out more computations for less power, but AI demands for computation are fueling an explosion of investment in computational power. The AI technology we have today is due in part to the enormous computational power we have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My hope for the future of AI is that we will be able to have a meaningful impact on predicting climate change. As humans become more confident in AI, we will be able to rely on technology more to understand climate change and to make more accurate predictions and models. This will allow us to be more targeted in our strategies to mitigate the worst effects. Assurance in autonomy and AI is one area that needs to be taken very seriously. Even if we don't think something is an AI problem today, it will be an AI problem next week or next month.\n",

      "The COP26 Glasgow process resulted in many countries strengthening their 2030 emissions reduction targets and announcing net-zero pledges for 2050–2070 but it is not clear how this would impact future warming. Here, we use four diverse integrated assessment models (IAMs) to assess CO2 emission trajectories in the near- and long-term on the basis of national policies and pledges, combined with a non-CO2 infilling model and a simple climate model to assess the temperature implications. We also consider the feasibility of national long-term pledges towards net-zero. While near-term pledges alone lead to warming above 2 °C, the addition of long-term pledges leads to emissions trajectories compatible with a future well below 2 °C, across all four IAMs. However, while IAM heterogeneity translates to diverse decarbonization pathways towards long-term targets, all modelled pathways indicate several feasibility concerns, relating to the cost of mitigation and the rates and scales of deployed technologies and measures.\n",

      "In the Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, countries agreed to hold global mean temperature rise to well below 2 °C while aiming to limit it to 1.5 °C. The scientific community has since focused its efforts on understanding what it would take for the world to meet this target1. Modellers have looked at requirements to meet the most stringent 1.5 °C ambition2, quantifying the necessary transformations3,4 and the consequences of living in a 2 °C rather than a 1.5 °C world5. Initial climate pledges in the context of Paris negotiations were soon found inadequate6 but, despite the slower-than-necessary pace7,8, countries have kept ramping up their ambition since. Several studies have quantified the actual impact of international policy efforts9,10,11, showcasing that ‘business-as-usual’ scenarios that are loosely defined and/or miss this impact of hitherto efforts are not helpful12,13, increasing pressure for better, more realistic analysis of where the world is heading14. A growing body of literature15,16,17, thus, shed light on what policies currently in place and what official 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) would yield, establishing their inadequacy to limit warming to 2 °C (refs. 18,19).\n",

      "Although the critical climate talks of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26)—a milestone for ratcheting ambition—were delayed by a year due to COVID-19, parties followed up on their commitments; by the time COP26 was completed in Glasgow in November 2021, more than 120 countries had upgraded their 2030 targets20 and major emitters representing over 70% of global CO2 emissions had announced and/or adopted net-zero commitments21. A handful of studies attempted to quickly assess the outcome of these new promises22,23,24,25,26,27, showing that—if fully implemented—global climate ambition could hold global temperature rise to just below 2 °C by 2100. More efforts to comprehend the effect of the new generation of NDCs and long-term targets (LTTs) followed28,29. Nonetheless, each of these studies was based on a single model and, despite stagnation of such bold promises largely due to the current energy crisis30, a multimodel assessment of global climate pledges remains critical. Our study contributes to this research gap, aiming to enhance robustness and confidence in our knowledge of possible global warming outcomes, by exploiting a diverse ensemble of integrated assessment models (IAMs) and breaking down the climate action gap in an implementation gap (temperature difference between current policies and NDCs), a long-term ratchet gap (temperature difference between NDCs followed or not by LTTs) and a long-term ambition gap (difference between temperature achieved by LTTs and the 1.5 °C goal) (Fig. 1; ‘Climate action gap definition’ in Methods).\n",

      "Model diversity also implies a plurality of modelling paradigms, theories, solution mechanisms and thus pathways that each model yields31. Given the political commitment to 1.5 °C—which was further strengthened in the Glasgow Climate Pact1—and the ambition reflected in announced net-zero pledges, special emphasis is increasingly placed on thresholds or boundaries that modelled pathways must stay within to be considered feasible32. According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6), feasibility refers to the potential for a mitigation (or adaptation) option to be implemented, on the basis of diverse context-dependent factors33—including institutional, financial and political34,35,36. Conversely, from a modelling perspective, feasibility refers to quantifiable geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic and even sociocultural factors37. Feasibility assessments hitherto referred to challenges at the global level38,39 and/or have been used to explicitly assess 1.5 °C-compliant pathways40, without touching upon regional feasibility concerns of decarbonization pathways required to achieve announced pledges. Our study builds on the multidimensional feasibility assessment framework established by ref. 38, to identify where and when the largest bottlenecks to achieving climate targets can be found, from a socioeconomic, technological and physical feasibility perspective (Fig. 1; ‘Feasibility assessment’ in Methods). However, a key novelty of our study lies in the expansion of the regional disaggregation of this framework, allowing us to assess to what extent and from which perspective countries’ policy targets, NDCs and LTTs are feasible.\n",

      "We use three scenarios, each corresponding to a different level of climate action or stated ambition, as announced by June 2022 (Fig. 1): a scenario with current emissions reduction policies until 2030, with post-2030 extrapolation maintaining 2020–2030 emission intensity (EI) tendencies (‘Scenario protocol’ in Methods); a scenario with current NDC targets for 2030, with the same EI extrapolation; and a scenario with NDC targets until 2030 followed by LTTs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To compare emissions between scenarios we focus on global CO2 emissions from energy and industrial processes to 2050 as all our IAMs represent these emissions sources as a minimum, while we include non-CO2 emissions and short-lived climate forcers in our temperature assessment (see below). When including all relevant national and regional energy and climate policies on top of socio- and technoeconomic baseline assumptions, we find that CO2 emissions will stabilize or start declining in the current decade, reaching 33–38 Gt by 2030 (Fig. 2). If policy effort is sufficiently strengthened to reach stated NDC targets, we find across models that emissions are reduced towards 2030, reaching 30–33 Gt. If all countries continue their declining trend in EI of gross domestic product (GDP) beyond 2030, global emissions will achieve levels of around 24–30 and 19–23 Gt by 2050—for current policies and NDCs, respectively. However, if countries accelerate action post-2030 to meet their long-term emission targets, we find 2050 emissions in the range of 10–13 Gt.\n",

      "Model spread is largest for current policies, since models run largely in forecasting mode, simulating the impact of policies relative to a model-dependent no-policy baseline. Despite harmonization of many input assumptions to reduce unwanted response heterogeneity (‘Scenario protocol’ in Methods), no-policy baselines tend to differ strongly, driven by inherent model characteristics and remaining unharmonized inputs18. Therefore, despite the converging effect of modelling a common set of current energy and climate policies, model variation still tends to be large in such exercises14,41 (Table 1). Model spread for emissions substantially decreases when emission targets from NDCs and LTTs are used as absolute constraints. The remaining emission spread can be explained by a mix of factors, such as model regions overperforming their targets, differences in regional aggregation and the CO2 versus non-CO2 share in emissions reductions. While total emissions outcomes between models converge when applying constraints, the distributions of emissions over the different sectors diverge between the models, reflecting the heterogeneity of mitigation pathways preferred by each model (Extended Data Fig. 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although temperature outcomes depend on all CO2 emissions (energy, industrial processes and land use), the remaining Kyoto gases (CH4, N2O and fluorinated gases) and short-lived climate forcers (SO2, black and organic carbon and so on), most of our models only cover a subset of those (Table 1). Therefore, we estimate the temperature implications of our scenarios after infilling missing GHGs and climate forcers, harmonizing the emission data and running the emission outcomes through the simple climate model FaIR (‘Temperature assessment’ in Methods). We find that current ambition levels signalled through implemented energy and climate policies will increase global temperatures to 2.1–2.4 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, depending on the model (1.9–2.7 °C when including climate uncertainty at the 25–75% interval), while ambition levels stated in present NDCs slightly limit this increase to 2.0–2.2 °C (1.7–2.5 °C for 25–75% interval). In both cases, warming will continue after 2100, as global CO2 emissions will not yet have reached net-zero levels. If countries also comply with their stated LTTs after meeting their current NDC pledges in 2030, temperature increase will be further limited and stabilize around 1.7–1.8 °C (1.5–2.0 °C for 25–75% interval), which is arguably in line with a future ‘well below 2 °C’ (ref. 42). Depending on the model applied, this translates to an implementation gap of 0.1–0.4 °C additional warming on the one hand and a long-term ratchet gap equivalent to another 0.2–0.5 °C of warming on the other. The remaining global ambition gap compared to the Paris target of keeping global temperature increase to 1.5 °C would be around 0.2–0.3 °C for all models. For three out of four models (General Equilibrium Model of International–National Interactions between Economy, Energy and the Environment (GEMINI), Modular energy systems Simulation Environment (MUSE) and Times Integrated Assessment Model (TIAM)), the long-term ratchet gap contributes most to the entire climate action gap. This confirms previous assessments showing that mitigation in current NDCs is not aligned with LTTs for most countries24,28. For the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the implementation gap contributes most to the entire gap, instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Disaggregating the emission results for the six largest emitters (Fig. 4) shows where the different gaps are more relevant. The implementation gap is measured to be largest (in relative terms) for the US and Japan, which have relatively ambitious NDCs but their policies are lagging behind. For countries with relatively less ambitious NDCs, like China, India and Russia, the implementation gap is smaller or non-existent, as existing policies overachieve NDC targets in several cases. In the European Union (EU), the implementation gap is relatively small due to ambitious policies. The long-term ratchet gap is substantial for all cases, meaning that, with current NDC targets, all six regions require a notable boost in post-2030 climate action for their net-zero targets to be achievable. However, differences between models are non-negligible, as GCAM shows an implementation gap in all countries, except Russia, while GEMINI does only for the US. Driven largely by announced emissions targets, pathways towards LTTs are relatively similar between the models, except India and Russia, due to different modelled or assumed contributions from non-CO2 emissions and natural sinks towards net-zero targets. We have not assessed the ambition gap at the country level, as that would require an assessment of fairness and equity43.\n",

      "\n",
      "The feasibility of the modelled scenarios based on national policies and targets is measured by comparing specific scenario outcomes with predetermined thresholds (Supplementary Section 2). Surpassing a threshold indicates that the feasibility of achievement in that dimension might become concerning. Global results show that feasibility concerns vary strongly between models, between scenarios and over time (Fig. 3a). Logically, deeper mitigation efforts imply larger feasibility concerns, as they drive models further away from their emissions-unconstrained baselines. Achieving stated LTTs among all countries—the only option of keeping temperature increase well below 2 °C (Fig. 2)—implies that regional feasibility thresholds must be passed three-to-six times (global weighted average and with median thresholds), depending on the model, and aggregated over the different feasibility dimensions. The feasibility metrics are only based on mitigation and do not consider the adaptation challenges that are driven by lack of mitigation. In fact, the feasibility of adequate adaptation to make up for lack of mitigation may be substantially more concerning—that is, in terms of costs, pace of investment scale-up and land and freshwater availability44,45—but this is outside the scope of this study. These feasibility concerns can, therefore, be best understood as key aspects requiring attention for successful implementation of the ambitious mitigation policies.\n",

Similarly, scores of 0.5 and 1.5 mean surpassing the thresholds by, respectively, 50% and 150%. As long as the threshold is not passed, even if it comes close, the feasibility concern is measured as zero. Similarly for all indicators, the global value is built up as a weighted average of the independent values in all model regions. See Table 2, Methods and Supplementary Section 3 for further details.\n",

      "Since the models differ substantially in structure, resulting in a wide variety of mitigation pathways, this also translates to large variations in the level and timing of feasibility concerns between the four models (Table 1), with GEMINI showing the lowest concerns and MUSE the highest. However, the distribution of feasibility concerns over the different dimensions and over time are crucial for the interpretation. For example, the high overall concern for MUSE is largely driven by high carbon prices and demand reduction pathways. In contrast, these dimensions are hardly of concern for GCAM and TIAM, where the pace of technology deployment and—in the case of GCAM—reliance on bioenergy and CCS are the main sources of feasibility concern. When evaluating feasibility concerns over time, all three TIAM scenarios stand out for showing most near-term concerns, predominantly related to the high pace of wind and solar energy deployment to deliver on 2030 targets. In GCAM, feasibility concerns are relatively small in the run-up to 2030 but arise in later periods, largely driven by increasing reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The latter is concerning from three different feasibility perspectives, pace of technology deployment, availability of sustainable bioenergy resources and geological carbon storage capacity.\n",

      "Mitigation scenarios in this study are entirely driven by country-specific climate policies and ambitions, hence we also specify an overview of measured feasibility concerns for the six largest emitters, averaged over 2020–2050 (Fig. 4). While again large differences between models exist, overall, we see relatively low concerns in China and Russia and high concerns in the US, the EU and Japan. These differences are probably driven by more ambitious targets in the latter group, which—despite being already in an emissions reduction phase for at least a decade—still confront high feasibility constraints to meet their near- and longer-term targets. Specific feasibility issues that stand out include energy demand reductions in the US (GEMINI), carbon pricing in the EU (MUSE) and bioenergy and carbon storage potentials for Japan (GCAM). Feasibility concerns about the pace of technology deployment play a relatively small role in China, the US and the EU, as opposed to India, Russia and Japan.\n",

      "The interpretation of the measured feasibility concerns can be subjective. The predetermined thresholds are not set in stone and often large ranges for such thresholds exist in literature38,39, while threshold levels strongly affect measured feasibility concerns—as showcased in a sensitivity analysis illustrating the impact of threshold uncertainty on feasibility concern values (Fig. 3b). Experts in different fields may have very different views on what is feasible or not. At the same time, our definition of feasibility is defined by ten indicators, as constrained by our modelling capacity (Table 2; ‘Feasibility assessment’ section in Methods); including other indicators in the analysis might have highlighted different dimensions and affected overall (aggregate) feasibility levels. Also, country-specific features, such as country size, stage of development, economic structure or access to international financial markets, would influence the threshold level. While some of these features are weighted in the feasibility assessment (for example, the thresholds for carbon pricing depend on GDP per capita levels), not all can be considered (for example, economic structure). Moreover, our feasibility assessment only applies to the underlying socioeconomic ‘storyline’ provided in the scenario protocol (‘Scenario protocol’ in Methods). Emissions associated with our pathways, largely constrained by 2030 NDCs and net-zero targets, are not subject to wide variation across storylines, as the latter would be without emissions constraints46 (noting that, for India and China, the emissions-intensity-based NDCs will vary according to their projected economic growth). However, existing analysis shows that key feasibility-related indicators of 1.5 °C pathways—including average annual CO2 sequestration from negative emissions, scale-up of low-carbon primary energy share, final energy demand and carbon prices—show considerable variation across storylines (in this case the shared socioeconomic pathways47), even for a given model2. Such analysis also demonstrates that intermodel variation is comparably wide in many cases, so a multimodel assessment (even with one storyline) still usefully highlights the potential range of each feasibility indicator.\n",

      "A final consideration around feasibility is that the thresholds are not immutable laws—indeed, some historical cases prove that the chosen thresholds can be overcome. Two examples are the surge of gas-fired power in the Netherlands and nuclear power in France, which respectively surged from 5% to 80% and 25% to 75% of the power mix in one decade, surpassing the applied feasibility threshold in this study over tenfold. Since such historical examples of fast transitions are typically driven by public policy and support48, the feasibility analysis can also be interpreted as a mapping exercise of where policy support is strongly needed to overcome existing constraints, which is crucial for achieving stated climate targets as all models and scenarios in this study surpass several feasibility thresholds. Nevertheless, as the results show, this mapping strongly depends on the applied model: deep structural differences between models lead to a wide variety of pathways reaching the same climate targets and, hence, different policy interventions are necessary from different modelling perspectives to make these pathways feasible.\n",

      "Our results suggest that, if announced national near-term (2030) and longer-term (2050–2070) emissions reduction ambitions throughout the world are achieved, global peak temperature increase will stay below 2 °C with ~75% certainty. However, if climate action is not strengthened post-2030, long-term ambitions will not be achievable (long-term ratchet gap) and global temperature increase will be around or above 2 °C by 2100. All applied models agree that—with the current pace of policy implementation—temperature increase will not exceed 2.5 °C over the course of the century but will still have a rising trend thereafter. These results clearly show that climate action and ambitions have notably improved since 2020, when the same set of models and scenario structure projected 2030 emissions to be on average 3 GtCO2 higher (Extended Data Fig. 2) and mean global temperature 0.2–0.3 °C warmer by 210018. This improvement, alongside our finding that global emissions are set to peak in the current decade with current NDCs, is in line with earlier post-COP26 assessments22,23,24,27,28,29. The latter assessments, however, also found increasing emissions for current policy scenarios throughout and after the 2020s22,27,28,29, whereas all models in our study find reduction or stabilization of emissions with current policies within this decade. Furthermore, using a diverse set of different IAMs and thus covering a large part of structural uncertainty while reducing undesired model response heterogeneity, our study offers a more robust assessment of emissions and warming implications of post-Glasgow pledges and action, compared to these earlier single-model assessments.\n",

      "\n",
      "Accounting for post-2030 extrapolations of current policies and NDCs, this study shows substantially lower emissions and end-of-century temperatures than other studies; additionally, our multimodel LTT projections are slightly more optimistic (by ~0.1 °C). An important reason for this difference probably lies in the applied extrapolation method: in contrast to a continued trend in emission intensities used in this study, other studies applied a carbon price equivalent to 2030 action and increasing over time with GDP levels23,27,28,29, a method leading to more conservative emissions reductions in most models18. There is no straightforward answer on which policy extrapolation method is better: while continuing a trend in emissions reductions may falsely bank on an emissions reduction trend that might not be equally attainable in the future, relying on extrapolated carbon prices may put too much faith in highly uncertain future model assumptions, especially considering that, for example, the decline in costs of low-carbon technologies have traditionally been underestimated in such assumptions12. Another important difference with several other model studies in the literature is that current policies are modelled explicitly (that is, not proxied via carbon prices until 2030; Supplementary Data) and on top of an up-to-date, harmonized set of socioeconomic and technoeconomic assumptions. This contributes to the relatively optimistic assessment of 2030 emissions in the study, as it endogenously assumes ratcheting of emissions reduction targets (by overperforming on these targets), where these are not ambitious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our scenario structure reflects three levels of ambition, where for each separate model region emissions are equal or lower with each subsequent level of ambition. Similarly, uncertainty to reach the modelled emissions reduction also increases with each subsequent level of ambition. Hence, despite aggregated national ambitions being in line with a temperature future well below 2 °C, the likelihood of all these national ambitions being achieved should not be overestimated. For each individual country that fails to meet its targets, the probability of higher temperature levels increases. Our feasibility analysis shows that, for most countries, it is far from straightforward to achieve their stated near- and long-term ambitions with the anticipated future demand patterns and technologies. The analysis reveals that there is no ‘free lunch’ in terms of feasibility of mitigation pathways: while different model structures imply heterogenous pathways to decarbonize economies in line with proposed pledges, each of the pathways compatible with a temperature future well below 2 °C faces substantial feasibility challenges, either in socioeconomic, technology scale-up, physical or sustainability dimensions. However, such feasibility challenges should not be interpreted as hard barriers to meet pledged mitigation targets but rather as areas where additional policy support or breakthroughs in technology or consumer behaviour49 may be needed to overcome such challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our results show that aggregating all national near- and long-term emissions reduction targets is still insufficient to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 °C (long-term ambition gap), which is the highest ambition of the Paris Agreement. Even if the most ambitious scenarios in this study are achieved, the temperature increase may still cause notable and damaging climate impacts50 and be sufficiently strong to activate several climate tipping elements, such as the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet and the die-off of low-latitude coral reefs51,52. Therefore, even if ambitions have substantially improved in the run-up to and shortly after COP26, either cumulative emissions until 2050 must be reduced more to avoid overshooting the 1.5 °C target, or substantive negative emissions should be achieved after reaching LTTs to reach 1.5 °C by 2100 with a high overshoot (Extended Data Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the results of this study show that, while the focus on further ambition ratcheting should not be lost8, the short- and long-run implementation of the existing set of ambitions is currently the most relevant factor to avoid a climate disaster.\n",

These are selected to reflect the broad diversity of modelling theories, spanning a range from least-cost energy system optimization to partial and general equilibrium and to agent-based modelling. Diversity of modelling structure, theory and solution is typically sought in multimodel studies, aiming to reach robust estimates by reflecting structural uncertainty—rather than parametric uncertainty, which has been minimized to reduce unwanted response heterogeneity41.\n",

This means that, despite also being driven by market equilibrium, this equilibrium is assumed to take place simultaneously in each market/region. Its richer representation of the economy requires calibration to data on national and international socio-accounting information and a vector of various elasticities of substitution but it allows endogenous calculation of market prices of inputs and outputs.\n",

It is bottom-up, in that it assumes short-term microeconomic equilibrium on the energy system by iterating market clearance across all sector modules and interchanging price and quantity of each energy commodity in each region but it is also agent-based, in that it tries to determine a mitigation pathway by providing an as-realistic-as-possible description of the investment and operational decision-making in each geographical region within a sector.\n",

For GDP projections, the IMF WEO of April 202258 for GDP growth until 2027 the OECD EO-109 (2021)59 for post-2027 growth projections, reflecting the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as initial estimated impacts related to the Ukraine conflict. On technoeconomic assumptions, power generation technology costs were updated to observed 2020 values (IRENA) while maintaining the future evolution of costs as reflected in ref. 41. For hydrogen, projections of different production technologies were updated according to IEA estimates (2017)60. It should be noted that, despite considerable efforts to harmonize model inputs, the four IAMs do not all represent the same portfolio of technologies; this hampers the efforts of reducing unwanted heterogeneity of responses and of attributing the resulting model spread only to structural uncertainty. However, our multimodel assessment remains useful in that it provides an implicit assessment of the variety of pathways that could result not just from structural differences but also from different assumptions around the availability of key technologies (for example, direct air capture61,62).\n",

Post-2030 action is then modelled by measuring the average rate of change in emissions intensity of GDP from 2020 to 2030 in each region and assuming emissions-intensity reduction rates will remain the same after 2030. This method is also used by refs. 18,22,15 to assess the long-term implications of NDCs. The applied policy targets until 2030 (for example, renewable energy mix targets, vehicle fuel standards) are maintained as minimum levels beyond 2030 to avoid backtracking of achieved policies.\n",

These NDC targets are applied on top of current policies (CP) modelled in the previous scenario; in model regions where current policies overachieve on the mitigation targets in NDCs, no additional emission constraints are applied, following ref. 18. Emissions reductions in NDC scenarios are therefore never less ambitious than what CP implies. The same EI method is applied for post-2030 action as in CP_EI.\n",

In such cases, the emissions level (E) should be calculated by applying the LTT to the estimated emissions share of that specific country (i) in the entire model region (j) according to either the 2019 emissions levels53 or, if available, the country´s emissions share in the aggregated NDC target for 2030 and applying the EI method for the rest of the region:\n",

      "In most instances, the first stage of the temperature assessment is to harmonize the global emissions trajectories to known values in 2015 (interpolated if not already present) using ratio-based harmonization approach63. Since not all models report the entire set of GHGs and other pollutants required for a complete temperature assessment, unreported emissions from each model participating in this intermodal comparison exercise are infilled using Silicone v.1.3.0 (ref. 64), using a quantile rolling window with CO2 emissions from energy and industrial processes as the lead emissions and based on an infilling database comprised of the harmonized AR6 database65 filtered to match the model philosophy. The models that are included in the AR6 database are categorized on the basis of their model type (for example, general equilibrium/partial equilibrium) and solution type (recursive dynamics/intertemporal). The exception to this is the F-gases (SF6, HFCs and PFCs), which are not reported by enough models in each category. For these cases (where not reported otherwise), we use the F-gas total infilled as above, then break it down into its component SF6, HFC total and PFC total using the whole harmonized AR6 database and the Silicone technique DecomposeCollectionTimeDepRatio. For the GEMINI-E3 model simulating global economy dynamics over the time horizon 2015 to 2050, we extend each of the emissions until 2100 for each scenario using the Silicone tool ExtendLatestTimeQuantile, using the whole AR6 database. Plotting the infilled trajectories of Kyoto gases instead of fossil CO2 produces very similar results, as fossil CO2 correlates well with the Kyoto gas total in the AR6 database (Supplementary Fig. 3) and our infilling technique preserves the correlation between the modelled gas and all the constituents.\n",

It is with these two trajectories (current policies as in ‘where we stand’ and 1.5 °C as in ‘where we want to go’) and the two intermediate trajectories (NDCs as in ‘ambition reflected in near-term targets’ and LTTs as in ‘ambition reflected in long-term targets’) that we define the different gaps in this study. The first gap, hereby termed ‘implementation gap’, refers to the difference in 2100 or peak temperature (depending on whether a peak is reached in the twenty-first century) of current policies and that of 2030 NDCs, both extended by EI trends. The second gap, hereby termed ‘long-term ratchet gap’, refers to the temperature difference between the 2030 NDCs extended by EI trends, on the one hand and the 2030 NDCs followed by LTTs (where stated), on the other—in other words, it refers to the pace, in which post-2030 action must be accelerated relative to pre-2030 action to deliver on LTTs. The final gap, hereby termed ‘ambition gap’, refers to the difference between the peak temperature of 2030 NDCs followed by available LTTs and the 1.5 °C target. These three gaps, altogether making up the climate action gap, are illustrated in detail in Fig. 1 and are not to be confused with the United Nations Environment Programme definition of ‘emissions gap’19; the latter refers to the emissions difference between the promised reductions (as in NDCs and/or LTTs) and the needed reductions (as in least-cost pathways delivering 1.5 °C), which we do not calculate.\n",

This feasibility analysis builds largely on the framework of ref. 38, measuring feasibility concerns by comparing specific model outcomes with threshold values found in the literature. It also defines feasibility as in that framework, that is, as the degree to which a scenario lies within the boundaries of diverse societal capacities for change in a given period. However, the reflected dimensions are largely constrained by the capacity to quantify with all models used in this study, while overlapping dimensions are avoided to allow a fair comparison of feasibility concerns between models.\n",

Therefore, our analysis does not include bottom-up sociopolitical dimensions that cannot be quantified in (all) our models and our definition of feasibility should not be interpreted as broadly as defined in literature68,69 but defined by the modelled dimensions considered—hence, we discuss ‘feasibility concerns’ rather than feasibility.\n",

Identically for all indicators, a value of the size of 1 represents that the specific threshold for that indicator is surpassed by 100% in that specific model region and period. Similarly, scores of 0.5 and 1.5 mean surpassing the thresholds by, respectively, 50% and 150%. That also means that, as long as the threshold is not passed, even if it comes close, the feasibility concern is measured as zero. Similarly for all indicators, the global value is built up as a weighted average of the independent values in all model regions. The weighting variable, however, varies between the different indicators (Table 2). For more details on how the different feasibility indicators are approached, on the precise threshold levels as well as the sources these levels are taken from, see Supplementary Section 2.

      "In the 1500s, the artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder produced a painting about people's indifference to distant suffering. Called Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, a copy of the original that's now on display in Brussels shows a farmer ploughing his field in the foreground. It's only when you look carefully that you can see Icarus drowning in the sea in the distance, surrounded by melted feathers, his legs flailing in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Landscape with the Fall of Icarus - a painting that depicts the effect of psychological distancing (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a decade ago, the psychologists Nira Liberman and Yaacov Trope used Bruegel's painting to introduce an idea in the journal Science that describes how time and distance shape people's attitudes – and specifically, their empathy towards others. They called it \"construal level theory\". The farmer is indifferent to the plight of Icarus, they argued, because he is far away. With geographical distance comes psychological distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's an idea that holds particular relevance this week as the east coast of North America experiences low air quality and dystopian orange skies due to wildfires in Canada. Some on social media – notably quite a few Californians who have already faced such impacts – have speculated that the pollution may sharpen the realities of climate change for many east coasters. Could it change hearts and minds, they wonder, because the impacts are so close to home? Others pointed to the symbolism of the United Nations building in New York City, shrouded in smog.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How much truth is there to this? Do climate impacts that are \"near\" in time and space change people's attitudes towards mitigation and adaptation?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Canada wildfires, air quality across the east coast of the US has plummeted (Credit: Getty Images)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "According to construal level theory, people's awareness and willingness to act on climate change should, in principle, be influenced by how psychologically close they perceive its impacts to be. If they formerly believed climate change was mainly about melting ice caps, drought in the developing world or disappearing island nations – and all those are far away in space and time – then their concern should be lower. In 2011, one psychologist referred to psychological distance as one of the \"dragons of inaction\" for preventing climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't necessarily callous behaviour, according to psychologists. In Bruegel's painting, the farmer has more immediate needs and priorities – perhaps he's intent on feeding his own family – so it's harder to notice and extend empathy towards Icarus's suffering in the ocean far away. People's circle of concern is often drawn near to them, meaning that they will care more about someone close to home, rather than on the opposite side of the world.\n",

      "However, on reviewing the literature up to 2020, the psychologist Roberta Maiella of G. d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara in Italy and colleagues found that the reality was more complex and nuanced than first appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is indeed evidence that proximity to climate impacts influences people's views. For example, in 2011 Alexa Spence of the University of Nottingham and colleagues surveyed UK residents exposed to coastal flooding, and found that they perceived greater uncertainty about the climate and more willingness to restrict energy use. And another study of participants in 24 countries showed that people with personal experience of climate change were more likely to do things like use less air conditioning in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, not all studies have confirmed the correlation as strong, and the methodologies to study the effect differ. In one study where US participants were presented with the impact of climate change in the Maldives, researchers used cues that aimed to reduce people's psychological distance and make the remote island nation feel nearer. This included asking them to trace the distance from Ithaca in New York to the remote island nation on a map, and watch a video about how sea level rise was affecting Maldives citizens. People given these cues judged the Maldives to be spatially closer, but crucially, this didn't translate into increased support for climate change mitigation policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "People's prior political affiliation may also matter. One 2020 study of Californians’ response to nearby wildfires suggested that close exposure to damage fostered support for pro-environmental policies in Democratic areas, but not Republican ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A clearer New York skyline earlier this year may feel a distant memory for some (Credit: Getty Images)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So will the awful air and darkened skies in New York City and other east coast cities influence people's attitudes there? Perhaps for some – but there are clearly other effects at play that influence beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There do seem to be ways to reduce psychological distance over climate change through effective communication. For instance, there's a well-known trick that charities often use called the \"identifiable victim effect\". When people are presented with a single human being facing the effects of climate change, this can foster greater empathy. In one study by psychologists Sabine Pahl at the University of Plymouth and Judith Bauer at the University of Erlangen in Germany, people were told a detailed story about a woman living in the future facing the impact of climate change. The pair told people how she'd burn her skin outside in the Sun, or get a rash after swimming in a polluted sea. Compared with those who had been given more \"fact-focused\" information about future warming, people who heard the woman's story were more likely to spend time reading about climate change afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, psychological distance is shaped by more than geography alone. But the evidence suggests that when climate change comes to people's neighbourhoods, it's likely to influence how many see it.\n",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A jury verdict that found an Oregon power company liable for devastating wildfires — and potentially billions of dollars in damages — is highlighting the legal and financial risks utilities take if they fail to take proper precautions in a hotter, drier climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Utilities, especially in the U.S. West, are increasingly finding themselves in a financial bind that’s partly of their own making, experts say. While updating, replacing and even burying thousands of miles of power lines is a time-consuming and costly undertaking, the failure to start that work in earnest years ago has put them on the back foot as wildfires have grown more destructive — and lawsuits over electrical equipment sparking blazes have ballooned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do they pay for that and at the same time try to do grid hardening at a pace that could prevent the need for constant shutting down of the power?” Josh Hacker, chief science officer at Jupiter Intelligence, a company that provides advice on managing climate change risks, said of lawsuit damages. “This is an enormous challenge. Now it’s biting them. And in the end it’s going to bite all of us, because they have to recover that expense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, a jury in Oregon found PacifiCorp liable for damages for negligently failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers during a windstorm over Labor Day weekend, despite warnings from top fire officials, and for its power lines being responsible for multiple blazes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PacifiCorp said it was disappointed with the jury’s decision and that it plans to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The fires were among the worst natural disasters in Oregon’s history. They killed nine people, burned more than 1,875 square miles (4,856 square kilometers) and destroyed upward of 5,000 homes and other structures. While total damages remain to be determined, they are expected to reach into the billions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because utilities make money from customers, they often raise revenue for infrastructure upgrades by hiking rates. In California, for example, Pacific Gas and Electric has requested to increase its rates for residential customers this year by roughly 18%, partly to bury more than 3,000 miles (4,828 kilometers) of overhead power lines underground, according to a fact sheet from the state’s public utilities commission. The commission, which regulates utility rates, said it expects to make a final decision on the request between July and September.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PG&E’s planned upgrades come amid heightened scrutiny of the utility, which serves more than 16 million people over 70,000 square miles (181,300 square kilometers) in central and northern California. Facing billions of dollars in damages stemming from multiple blazes, it filed for bankruptcy in 2019, shortly after its neglected equipment caused a fire that virtually razed the town of Paradise in the Sierra Nevada foothills in 2018. The Camp Fire was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California’s history.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PG&E’s bankruptcy settlement with wildfire victims was an eye-popping $13.5 billion. Only half of the money was paid to victims in cash, while the other half was paid out in PG&E stock, which has since declined in value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PacifiCorp, meanwhile, says it has invested hundreds of millions of dollars since the Labor Day 2020 fires in Oregon in upgrading its equipment and expanding its weather stations and weather modeling. But customers are also helping fund those investments. Oregon’s public utility commission approved rate increases for PacifiCorp in 2023 in part so that the utility could cover “non-energy costs,” including wildfire mitigation and vegetation management. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After the verdicts were handed down, PacifiCorp filed a request with Oregon’s public utility commission asking to potentially defer the costs linked to the lawsuit. The jury awarded around $90 million to 17 homeowners named as plaintiffs in the case, with damages to be determined later for a broader class that could include the owners of about 2,500 properties, as estimated by plaintiffs’ attorneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In its filing, PacifiCorp said the application would enable it “to preserve its ability to seek recovery in the future” in case potential future class-action damages “impact the financial stability of the company.” Such a move “would result in higher costs to customers,” the filing said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the company requested that the commission delay its consideration of the application until the costs of its wildfire-related claims are more fully known. Oregon’s public utility commission would have to approve the request.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The PUC recognizes the controversy that surrounds this filing,” Kandi Young, the commission’s spokesperson, said in an email. “When the time comes to take action, the PUC will establish an open and transparent public process in which all interested persons have the opportunity to present information and argument to the Commission, including PUC Staff, ratepayer advocates, PacifiCorp, other participants, and members of the public.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The revenue model of utilities — and the way some have settled previous wildfire claims — have raised questions about the extent to which such companies are truly being held accountable for their role in sparking wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is public safety and the durability of the entire system in the priorities of what are basically profit-making enterprises? That is the big question that is being addressed here,” said Scott McNutt, a part-time lecturer in bankruptcy law at the University of California, Davis, who also worked as counsel to the fee examiner in the PG&E bankruptcy case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Utilities, meanwhile, say the growing risk of wildfires to public safety is being driven by forces beyond their control, such as climate change and population growth in the wildland-urban interface — the boundary where development encroaches on natural areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“These systemic issues affect all Oregonians and are larger than any single utility,” PacifiCorp said in a statement earlier this week after the jury handed down one of its verdicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some experts agree to a certain extent, saying that hardening the electrical grid is just one of many critical steps that must be taken to protect people and their homes from wildfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Power companies ... should always be working to reduce any potential ignition risk,” said Michael Gollner, associate professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. “But you also want to make it so that if there are those fires, those fires aren’t going to cause death and destruction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Changing the materials that homes are built with, Gollner said, is one way communities can protect themselves from wildfires. Having fire-retardant roofs made of asphalt or tile instead of wood, covering vents with fine mesh to keep embers out, and having nonflammable siding can help prevent homes from burning down. Creating what’s known as a “defensible space” around one’s home — a buffer area where there is less vegetation, helping to slow down a fire’s progress — is also key. Prescribed burns and thinning out fuels in forests are important as well, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We haven’t taken a more holistic step to harden our communities so they don’t invite in fires,” he said. “We haven’t done the hard, other work.”\n",

      "Belgium backed the film “La Tierra Roja,” a love story set in the Argentine rainforest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Japan is financing a new coal plant in Bangladesh and an airport expansion in Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Funding for the five projects totaled $2.6 billion, and all four countries counted their backing as so-called “climate finance” – grants, loans, bonds, equity investments and other contributions meant to help developing nations reduce emissions and adapt to a warming world. Developed nations have pledged to funnel a combined total of $100 billion a year toward this goal, which they affirmed during climate talks in Paris in 2015. The funding helped crown Japan and the United States as two of the top five contributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a coal plant, a hotel, chocolate stores, a movie and an airport expansion don’t seem like efforts to combat global warming, nothing prevented the governments that funded them from reporting them as such to the United Nations and counting them toward their giving total.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In doing so, they broke no rules. That's because the pledge came with no official guidelines for what activities count as climate finance. Though some organizations have developed their own standards, the lack of a uniform system of accountability has allowed countries to make up their own. The U.N. Climate Change secretariat told Reuters it is up to the countries themselves to decide whether to impose uniform standards. Developed nations have resisted doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the wild, wild west of finance,” said Mark Joven, Philippines Department of Finance undersecretary, who represents the country at U.N. climate talks. “Essentially, whatever they call climate finance is climate finance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The four countries defended their programs as sound. Japanese officials consider the power and airport projects green because they include cleaner technology or sustainable features. A U.S. official said the hotel project counts because it includes stormwater controls and hurricane protection measures. A Belgian government spokesman defended counting the grant for the rain-forest movie as climate finance because the film touches on deforestation, a driver of climate change. An Italian government official said Italy aims to consider climate in all of its financing but did not elaborate on how the chocolate stores met that goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Developed nations reported more than 40,000 direct contributions toward the finance target, totaling more than $182 billion, from 2015 to 2020, the last year for which data is available. In an effort to understand how that money is being spent, reporters from Reuters and Big Local News, a journalism program at Stanford University, examined thousands of records  that countries submitted to the U.N. to document contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The system’s lack of transparency made it impossible to tell how much money is going to efforts that truly help reduce global warming and its impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Countries are not required to report project details. The descriptions they disclose are often vague or non-existent – so much so that in thousands of cases, they don’t even identify the country where the money went. Even receiving countries listed in the reports sometimes couldn’t say how the money was spent.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Developed nations have pledged $100 billion in annual funding to help developing countries reduce emissions and manage the impacts of climate change. They have not yet met the goal. From 2015 to 2020, 35 governments reported a total of more than $182 billion in grants, loans, bonds, equity investments and other contributions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Source: Reuters analysis of climate finance data nations reported to the U.N.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is not universal. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada and the Netherlands, do submit detailed reports, and Reuters tallied tens of billions of dollars in spending from at least 33 countries that aligned with stated climate goals. That included investments in renewable energy and projects that build resilience to natural disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But billions in spending is scarcely documented, including that from top funder Japan, which accounts for nearly one-third of the funding pledged to date. Officials from Japan’s foreign ministry, which oversees its climate finance contributions, declined to describe any of the country’s funding decisions in detail. The country has drawn criticism from activists and other nations for including in its total projects that rely on fossil fuels or otherwise increase emissions. Japanese officials have argued that developing nations need fossil fuel projects that rely on cleaner technology while the world transitions to alternative power sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aiming to follow the money, Reuters and Big Local News asked 27 nations for details on funding they reported to the U.N, examined public documents and spoke to NGOs and others involved in reported projects. Reporters also cross-checked U.N. reports against information recorded by other agencies, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group representing mostly wealthy nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The review covered about 10% of the total reports to the U.N. It turned up at least $3 billion spent not on solar panels or wind farms but on coal-fired power, airports, crime-fighting or other programs that do little or nothing to ease the effects of climate change. Five climate specialists – including university professors, researchers and government officials focused on climate finance – agreed that the projects Reuters identified have little or no direct connection to climate change.\n",

      "Developed nations funded projects all over the world from 2015 to 2020 as part of their pledge to help developing countries reduce emissions and manage the effects of climate change. Because of vague reporting, it is impossible to tell where large sums of money went.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And more than $500 million was reported for projects that were later canceled with no funds paid out. Countries are still claiming that funding toward their climate finance pledges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, decisions to claim borderline projects as climate finance often don’t reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead, said Gaia Larsen, director of climate finance access at the World Resources Institute, a non-profit research organization that tracks climate finance. But when countries inflate their funding numbers with things like coal-fired power, she said, the result can resemble greenwashing – when companies make exaggerated or misleading claims about their environmental stewardship.\n",
      "\n",

      "The past eight years have been the hottest on record, according to a World Meteorological Organization alert published in January. Historic floods submerged a third of Pakistan and killed at least 1,700 people in 2022. Millions are facing starvation on the Horn of Africa in the worst drought in decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists say events like these are more likely and more intense because of Earth’s rapid warming, largely blamed on wealthy countries and the emissions they have released to power their economies. Now, as developing nations seek their own growth, they are under pressure to use more sustainable energy sources. Because many of these nations are in hot, tropical climates, they also bear a disproportionate share of global warming’s effects, such as rising seas, drought and extreme weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wealthy nations have acknowledged their role in the crisis and their responsibility to help other countries with the hefty cost of managing emissions and the effects of climate change. They committed, first in 2009 and again in 2015 under the Paris climate agreement, to a collective goal: $100 billion a year in grants, loans, private sector investments and more by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a decade after the first pledge was made, nations have yet to meet their promise. They fell $16.7 billion short of the $100 billion goal in 2020 and are expected to miss it again when contributions are tallied for 2021 and 2022, according to OECD estimates. There are no penalties for missing the target, aside from criticism from those who say governments are not doing enough to combat global warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There, anger and anxiety over the failure of rich nations to meet the funding goal helped developing nations win a key concession: Developed nations agreed to work on setting up a new fund to cover the costs of damage already caused by climate change. Until now, most funding has been focused on reducing emissions or adapting to expected changes.\n",

At this year’s COP28 in Dubai, they will debate the goal’s size, who should contribute and over what time period, and any rules governing how it is delivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some officials from potential recipient countries say that, before more money starts to flow, clearer definitions of what qualifies as climate finance and more transparency in reporting contributions are needed. More than 100 times since 2012, developing nations or groups acting on their behalf have called for such improvements, according to a Reuters review of U.N. submissions, videos of climate meetings and climate negotiation bulletins.\n",

      "Much has been written about the major impacts of climate change. Effects such as rising global surface temperatures, higher sea levels, longer and more intense heat waves, melting glaciers and ice sheets, polar sea ice loss, extreme weather and climate events, and impacts on animal habitats are well-documented and in the news regularly.\n",

      "In this new NASA Climate feature series, we’re examining some of the lesser-known, and often surprising, ways Earth’s changing climate is affecting our world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the Industrial Revolution, human travels had little impact on Earth’s climate. That changed once we began burning fossil fuels to power trains, boats, cars, trucks, and planes. Today, transportation generates about a fourth of global carbon dioxide emissions, second only to the electric power sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change is affecting transportation in major ways, such as the ongoing shift to zero-emissions automobiles. But some of the impacts of climate on transportation are less obvious. Here are a few.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our changing atmosphere may make future airline flights bumpier by strengthening vertical wind shear in jet streams. Jet streams are fast-moving belts of wind that travel around the planet in wavy, meandering paths in the upper parts of the atmosphere. Aviators often use or avoid them to increase the efficiency of their flights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vertical wind shear creates irregular air motions called turbulence, which is a significant and costly issue for airlines, resulting in injuries, damaged aircraft, delayed flights, and inspections and investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes bumpy flights happen without significant cloudiness or thunderstorms. This phenomenon is known as “clear-air turbulence.” British atmospheric scientist Paul Williams of the University of Reading studies clear-air turbulence. Among his findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "NASA develops technologies to improve aviation efficiency and maintain safety. Researchers at NASA’s Langley Research Center recently designed a special infrasound microphone that can \"hear\" ultralow frequencies generated by turbulence. This technology was tested on an uncrewed stratospheric glider called HiDRON.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change can also make it harder for aircraft to take off. As temperatures rise, air becomes less dense, so planes have a harder time generating the lift they need to become airborne. Because of this, some aircraft runways may not be long enough for certain planes to take off. It also might force aircraft operators to reduce the takeoff weight of planes and helicopters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of its most significant changes to the planet is the continuing decline of Arctic sea ice. Over the past 40 years, the amount of ice cover at both the annual maximum and minimum has shrunk, and the percentage of thick ice that survives from year to year has also dropped. As reported in 2018, this has opened the Arctic to new commerce opportunities, but also to serious environmental concerns. At the center of both lies the shipping industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the positive side, reduced sea ice cover is increasingly allowing ships to sail across the Arctic Ocean without support from icebreaker ships. This can significantly shorten travel times between Asia, Europe, and North America. As a result, many nations are preparing for more Arctic shipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also negatives. Scientists and environmentalists worry more shipping activity will increase pollution and oil spills and disturb marine life. And ships are still encountering plenty of ice as they sail closer to the North Pole and in waters that are not well charted. Increased exploration and tourism also mean search-and-rescue operations become more challenging for the U.S. and Canadian coast guards. Finally, some traditional travel routes over the sea ice (used by snowmobiles, trucks, and other vehicles) could become unsafe as the ice thins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and/or intensity of droughts and floods, so the impacts on water levels in rivers and reservoirs may become more severe and erratic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The impacts on shipping cargo by boat could be significant. Water levels can drop such that rivers can become too shallow to navigate, and some ships may have to carry less cargo to safely navigate a river. In the United States, cargo transport along the Mississippi River has been impacted in recent years. For example, low water in 2012 closed an 11-mile stretch of the Mississippi River near Memphis. Such closures have a big economic impact along the river.\n",

      "“These disparities can go up or down depending on how you implement climate policy,” said climate scientist Pascal Polonik, 2023 Scripps PhD graduate and lead author of the study. “It’s not a given that any climate policy that succeeds in reducing emissions also succeeds when it comes to environmental justice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a simulation that prioritized emissions reductions in neighborhoods with low household income showed increased air pollution inequality, as did a simulation that achieved the cuts needed for the U.S. to meet its Paris Agreement goals in the cheapest way possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Polonik said the study’s investigation of how the distribution of air quality might change under different climate policies was spurred by statements from the Biden administration that linked climate change and environmental justice, including the IRA and a 2021 executive order.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To explore this question, Polonik and his co-authors started with the U.S. national emissions inventory from 2017. Because pollutants, which are damaging to human health, are often released alongside greenhouse gases, the team was able to use this national emissions inventory and a computer model to create a map of air pollution in the U.S. under different climate policy implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the Paris Agreement emissions reduction goal, the team created a set of five reduction pathways based on different organizing principles. These five pathways reduced emissions by making equal cuts across the country, by focusing on low-income neighborhoods, by achieving the emissions cuts in the least costly way possible, by prioritizing communities of color, and by reducing emissions in the places with the worst air quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To represent an even wider array of potential climate policy scenarios, the researchers also ran an additional 300 computer simulations that randomized where the greenhouse gas reductions came from.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the team took these 305 scenarios and plugged the geographic distribution of their associated emissions reductions into an air quality model that could estimate how they would impact air pollution across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Polonik and his colleagues established the geographic air pollution consequences of each climate policy scenario, they could use census tract data to layer demographic information onto the map and then calculate how each scenario impacted the racial disparities compared to the unaltered data from 2017. For the randomized simulations, the team conducted additional statistical analyses to tease out which variables had the greatest impact on the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While no pathway completely eliminated the historical racial inequities that influence air pollution exposure, they all reduced the overall burden of air pollution. Two scenarios that are particularly relevant to real-world climate policy, however, exacerbated racial inequities. The emissions reduction simulation that prioritized low-income areas increased air pollution inequality by 0.2 percentage points, and the simulation that achieved emissions reductions at the lowest cost increased inequality by 0.5 percentage points.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The U.S. government has at times tried to use income as a way of targeting communities of color without using race or ethnicity as policy criteria,” said co-author Kate Ricke, assistant professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Scripps. “Our results show how that approach can fall short when it comes to environmental justice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The relevance of the lowest cost approach, especially in view of the dramatic emissions cuts needed to meet the U.S. Paris Agreement goals, is more obvious: This pathway’s estimated cost was $190 billion, compared with the most expensive pathway, which costs $340 billion. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“To some degree the U.S. might naturally prioritize what’s economically efficient,” said co-author Jennifer Burney, an environmental scientist at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Scripps. “But if you take an entirely economical approach to reducing emissions, our study suggests that it won't just fail to rectify existing racial and ethnic exposure inequalities, it could exacerbate them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The only scenario that enhanced environmental equity across all groups was the one that prioritized emissions reductions in communities of color, which reduced racial inequality by 2.6 percentage points. However, the U.S. government is unlikely to use race to target disadvantaged communities in climate policy due to the risk of legal challenges, according to Polonik. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathway that targeted locations with the most air pollution also reduced overall racial inequality by 1.1%, but actually increased the air pollution disparity for Hispanic communities. The scenario with equal emissions reductions across the country reduced racial inequality by 0.1%. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the analysis of the 300 randomized pathways revealed that greenhouse gas reductions coming from the transportation sector had the greatest potential to reduce racial disparities in air pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Climate policy can absolutely be used to reduce inequity in air pollution exposure,” said Polonik. “But naive implementation of climate policy doesn’t necessarily improve environmental equity, so it’s vital to adopt an approach to reducing emissions that explicitly factors in environmental justice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Polonik said that an explanation of why prioritizing emissions reductions in low-income areas or why taking the cheapest approach to reducing emissions ended up increasing racial air pollution disparities was beyond the scope of this study.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“These racial inequities are deeply ingrained and have been around for a long time,” said Polonik. “You can reduce emissions in a lot of different ways and this pattern will remain. If you’re not specifically targeting environmental inequality, it’s likely to persist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Polonik, Ricke, and Burney, School of Global Policy and Strategy Master of Public Policy student Sean Reese was a co-author of the study.\n",

      "Pakistan, like many countries around the world, is grappling with the profound challenges posed by climate change. As a developing nation highly vulnerable to its impacts, Pakistan faces a range of environmental, social, and economic consequences that demand immediate attention. The time has come for a collective and urgent effort to combat climate change in Pakistan, as failure to act decisively will only exacerbate the existing challenges and jeopardize the future of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most pressing concerns in Pakistan is the rising temperature, leading to extreme heat waves and longer, more intense periods of drought. These changes directly affect agriculture, the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, leading to crop failures and food insecurity for millions of people. Additionally, the melting glaciers in the Himalayas pose a severe threat, as they feed the country’s major rivers, and any disruption in their flow would exacerbate the already critical water scarcity issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate the impact of climate change, Pakistan must prioritize the transition to renewable energy sources. The nation has a vast potential for solar and wind energy, which remains largely untapped. By investing in renewable energy infrastructure, Pakistan can reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable development. Moreover, such a transition would create job opportunities, boost the economy, and enhance energy security in the long run.\n",

      "Melting glaciers in the Himalayas pose a severe threat as they feed the country’s major rivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sustainable Urban Planning: Pakistan’s rapid urbanization is a double-edged sword in terms of climate change. Unplanned urban growth leads to increased energy consumption, inefficient infrastructure, and pollution. To address this, there is a critical need for sustainable urban planning, with a focus on creating green spaces, improving public transportation, and adopting energy-efficient building practices. Prioritizing eco-friendly urban development will not only mitigate climate change but also improve the overall quality of life for citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan boasts diverse ecosystems, including unique forests, wetlands, and coastal areas, which are home to a rich array of flora and fauna. However, climate change poses a grave threat to this biodiversity. It is crucial to establish protected areas, conserve forests, and promote sustainable forestry practices. Reforestation initiatives should be prioritized to combat deforestation and enhance carbon sequestration. Moreover, by preserving natural habitats, Pakistan can safeguard its natural resources and promote ecotourism, contributing to both conservation and economic growth.:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing climate change requires collaboration at the international level. Pakistan should actively engage in global efforts, such as the Paris Agreement, and seek financial and technical assistance for climate adaptation and mitigation projects. Domestically, the government must establish and enforce comprehensive climate change policies, promoting renewable energy adoption, sustainable agriculture practices, and emission reduction targets. Public awareness campaigns and educational programs can also play a pivotal role in fostering a culture of environmental stewardship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change poses an existential threat to Pakistan’s future, affecting all aspects of society. Addressing this challenge requires immediate action, strong political will, and the involvement of all stakeholders. By embracing renewable energy, implementing sustainable urban planning, protecting biodiversity, and collaborating internationally, Pakistan can pave the way for a more resilient and sustainable future. Let us come together, transcend boundaries, and take the necessary steps to safeguard our planet and secure a better tomorrow for generations to come.\n",

      "Zac Lamas, post doctoral fellow at ORISE, holds a bee as he inspects them for the parasitic mite Varroa at a hive in the backyard of University of Maryland bee researcher Nathalie Steinhauer on Wednesday, June 21, 2023, in College Park, Md. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s honeybee hives just staggered through the second highest death rate on record, with beekeepers losing nearly half of their managed colonies, an annual bee survey found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But using costly and Herculean measures to create new colonies, beekeepers are somehow keeping afloat. Thursday’s University of Maryland and Auburn University survey found that even though 48% of colonies were lost in the year that ended April 1, the number of United States honeybee colonies “remained relatively stable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeybees are crucial to the food supply, pollinating more than 100 of the crops we eat, including nuts, vegetables, berries, citrus and melons. Scientists said a combination of parasites, pesticides, starvation and climate change keep causing large die-offs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year’s 48% annual loss is up from the previous year’s loss of 39% and the 12-year average of 39.6%, but it’s not as high as 2020-2021’s 50.8% mortality rate, according to the survey funded and administered by the nonprofit research group Bee Informed Partnership. Beekeepers told the surveying scientists that 21% loss over the winter is acceptable and more than three-fifths of beekeepers surveyed said their losses were higher than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a very troubling loss number when we barely manage sufficient colonies to meet pollination demands in the U.S.,” said former government bee scientist Jeff Pettis, president of the global beekeeper association Apimondia that wasn’t part of the study. “It also highlights the hard work that beekeepers must do to rebuild their colony numbers each year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall bee colony population is relatively steady because commercial beekeepers split and restock their hives, finding or buying new queens, or even starter packs for colonies, said University of Maryland bee researcher Nathalie Steinhauer, the survey’s lead author. It’s an expensive and time consuming process. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A colony of bees are visible at a hive in the backyard of University of Maryland bee researcher Nathalie Steinhauer, Wednesday, June 21, 2023, in College Park, Md. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The prognosis is not as bad as 15 years ago because beekeepers have learned how to rebound from big losses, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The situation is not really getting worse, but it’s also not really getting better,” Steinhauer said. “It is not a bee apocalypse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite big annual losses the situation is a far cry from 2007 when many bee experts expected an end to managed pollination said U.S. Department Agriculture research entomologist Jay Evans, who wasn’t part of the survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are threats certainly in the environment and honeybees have persisted,” Evans said. “I don’t think honeybees will go extinct but I think they will always have these sort of challenges.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some commercial beekeepers who have succeeded in the past lost as much as 80% of their colonies this past year, while other beekeepers did well, it varied so much, Evans said. Pettis, who has 150 colonies on Maryland’s Eastern shore, had less than 18% loss, saying he used organic acids for mite control.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Parasitic mite Varroa are visible on a hive, Wednesday, June 21, 2023, in College Park, Md. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The parasitic mite Varroa destructor that helps transmit viruses is the chief culprit, but bad weather and queen issues were also big problems in the past year, Steinhauer said. Pesticides also make things worse because it makes bees more vulnerable to diseases and less likely to seek food, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It really can be like death by a thousand cuts with the most obvious one being varroa,” Steinhauer said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The mite varroa is a flat creature that crawls on the bee – it would be the equivalent of a frisbee or flat softball on human bodies – Evans said. The mite seems to make it easier for viruses to attack and kill bees, he and Steinhauer said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It used to take large amounts of varroa, such as in 60% of a colony, to cause virus problems, but now even small infestations at 1% or 2% in a colony can cause massive problems, Steinhauer said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are fighting this evolving enemy,” Steinhauer said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem is landscapes that have only one crop or homogenous landscapes which deprive bees of food, while pesticides and bouts of extreme weather also have caused problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example in the Washington, D.C. area unusual 80-degree warmth in January brought some bees out of their normal winter routine and then when it turned cool again, they had problems, Evans said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The impact of climate change on bee colony survival is real and can go undetected,” Pettis said in an email.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The demand for pollination from commercial bee colonies is growing even as the beekeepers have to work harder to make up for losses, Steinhauer said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 35% of the human diet comes from insect-pollinated plants and the honeybee is responsible for 80% of that pollination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is this whole side of our agricultural industry that relies on these colonies,” Steinhauer said. “And the fact that every year the commercial beekeepers have to invest so much more effort to keep those numbers up because they have to fulfill those pollination contracts puts a lot of stress on those beekeepers and the bees.” ___\n",

      "MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Saudi Arabia has ambitious plans to welcome millions more pilgrims to Islam’s holiest sites. But as climate change heats up an already scorching region, the annual Hajj pilgrimage — much of which takes place outdoors in the desert — could prove even more daunting. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The increased number of pilgrims, with the associated surge in international air travel and infrastructure expansion, also raises sustainability concerns, even as the oil giant pursues the goal of getting half its energy from renewable resources by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next week, Saudi Arabia hosts the first Hajj pilgrimage without the restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Some 2.5 million people took part in the pilgrimage in 2019, and around 2 million are expected this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s wide-ranging plan to overhaul the kingdom’s economy, known as Vision 2030, 30 million pilgrims would take part in the Hajj and Umrah — a smaller, year-round pilgrimage. That would be an increase of more than 10 million from pre-pandemic levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It will require a vast expansion of hotels and other infrastructure in Mecca and Medina, ancient cities already largely obliterated by high-rises and shopping malls. The additional pilgrims will require more long-distance flights, more buses and cars, more water and electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Associated Press reached out to several Saudi officials with detailed questions but received no response. It’s unclear what, if any, studies the government has done on the environmental impact of the pilgrimage or whether that figures into its plans. And well-intentioned measures, like a high-speed railway network, aren’t enough to remove polluting traffic in and around the holy city. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The trains whip through the arid landscape at top speeds of 300 km/h (186 mph), carrying pilgrims in air-conditioned comfort from Jeddah to Mecca. But they stop several kilometers away from the Grand Mosque, meaning pilgrims must either walk at least an hour or take a bus or car to the holy site. The $19 one-way price from Jeddah’s airport to Mecca may also be out of reach for pilgrims on lower incomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims who are able to are required to undertake it at least once in their lives. For pilgrims, retracing the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad is a profound religious experience that wipes away sins, deepens one’s faith and unifies Muslims the world over. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Saudi royal family’s legitimacy is largely rooted in its custodianship of Islam’s holiest sites and its ability to host one of the largest annual religious gatherings on the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts have found that the Hajj both contributes to climate change and will be affected by it in the coming decades as one of the hottest places on Earth gets even warmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A study of the 2018 Hajj by experts from Victoria University in Melbourne estimated that the five-day pilgrimage produced over 1.8 million tons of greenhouse gases, roughly the amount New York City emits every two weeks. The biggest contributor was aviation, accounting for 87% of emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdullah Abonomi, a Saudi researcher and one of the authors of the study, said Saudi authorities have embraced sustainability as part of Vision 2030, which calls for preserving natural resources in order to attract pilgrims, tourists and businesses.\n",

      "In the past, he says, cars and buses packed with pilgrims filled the streets around Mecca, belching exhaust into the air, but expansion of the Grand Mosque has led to bigger courtyards and increased pedestrianisation in most of the routes leading to the holy site. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, human bottlenecks have replaced traffic, and garbage swirls in clouds of heat. For travel around Mina and Arafat, two crucial Hajj locations, cars and buses remain the two most widespread forms of transport. The journey by foot, in sweltering temperatures, is arduous but can prove faster than four wheels. \n",

      "In its Hajj ambitions, Saudi Arabia faces managing huge numbers of pilgrims in a rapidly warming world. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During the rituals, pilgrims often walk for hours outside, scale a desert hill known as the Mountain of Mercy, where the prophet is said to have delivered his last sermon, and cast stones at pillars representing the devil in a desert plain. They pack into the Grand Mosque in Mecca to circumambulate the Kaaba. On top of the exertions, the Hajj population skews to the elderly, who are more vulnerable to heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On an evening this week around sunset in Mecca, temperatures hovered around 37 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit). The crowds made it feel hotter, stifling any airflow. In a bustling basement supermarket near the Grand Mosque, pilgrims bought handheld fans that spray water on the face and every kind of umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2019 study by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that even if the world succeeds in mitigating the worst effects of climate change, the Hajj would be held in temperatures exceeding an “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052 and from 2079 to 2086.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Islam follows a lunar calendar, so the Hajj falls around 11 days earlier each year. In 2030, the Hajj will occur in April, and over the next several years it will fall in the winter, when temperatures are milder. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, Saudi authorities have installed large awnings and misters around holy sites to cool pilgrims. As temperatures climb, authorities will likely need to step up such measures or introduce new strategies like limiting pilgrim numbers in higher-heat years, the heat stress study concluded. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“People who want to do Hajj should get the opportunity to do it,” said Elfatih Eltahir, one of the study’s authors. “Global warming is going to make it a little bit more difficult — for some years, for some individuals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Muslim activists have launched grassroots initiatives aimed at a “green Hajj,” encouraging pilgrims to only make the journey once, to avoid single-use plastics and to offset carbon emissions by planting trees.\n",

      "The Hajj “can be green and sustainable if there are smart policies and technology to lower the ecological footprint,” said Odeh Jayyousi, a professor at the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain who researches sustainability and innovation.\n",

      "The use of biodegradable plastics, reusable tents, and renewable energy would cut down on greenhouse gases, he said. Artificial intelligence could be brought to bear on logistics, streamlining travel and ensuring that planes and busses are full and do not spend too much time idling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "A spate of serious wildfires across Canada have become a global story in recent weeks, accompanied by photos of murky orange-hued landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The fires have worsened air quality across the country and down into the neighbouring US, and required tens of thousands of people to be evacuated. With more than four million hectares (10 million acres) already burned it is now on track to be the country's worst wildfire season ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Canadian politicians were quick to connect the disaster with global warming. On Twitter, prime minister Justin Trudeau wrote that \"more and more of these fires\" were being seen because of climate change. Canada's environment and climate minister tweeted that they \"remind us that carbon pollution carries a cost on our society, as it accelerates climate change\". However, Ontario premier Doug Ford, who has tried to roll back a number of climate policies, declined to make the link.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a clear connection between climate change and the number and severity of wildfires worldwide. Attributing a particular fire or spate of fires to climate change, however, is more difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A key figure on wildfire risk tracked by scientists is \"vapour pressure deficit\" (VPD), which measures how well the atmosphere can pull moisture out of plants. The higher the deficit, the more likely trees and other vegetation are to ignite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is evidence that this deficit has increased over the past few decades. And, in the US at least, studies have linked rising VPD levels to climate change. But it is still not clear exactly how climate change will affect this deficit in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest report from scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021 found that fire weather – dry, hot, windy conditions that make it more likely for fires to take hold – is already a growing problem in many parts of the world and will become more common in some regions if climate change gets worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We know that human-induced climate change is warming Canada at about twice the global average rate,\" says Nathan Gillett, a research scientist at the Canadian government's environment department. A 2018 study by Canadian scientists found a significant rise in the number of large fires and area burned across Canada since 1959, with the fire season starting approximately one week earlier and ending one week later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But can we link a specific wildfire, or spate of wildfires, with climate change directly?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical datasets and complex statistical models have made it possible for researchers to show the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions on heatwaves around the world, for example, by making them more likely or severe.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wildfires, however, result from a complex interaction of factors, involving short-term weather and longer term climate patterns, the type of forests involved and what people are doing to them. And they all need something to spark them off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kira Hoffman, a researcher specialising in fire ecology at the University of British Columbia and the Bulkley Valley Research Centre, stresses that fire is a natural and common part of the ecosystem in western Canada, which is drier and more prone to lightning strikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, British Columbia's fire season was so bad in 2017 that it broke its own records for the area of land burned. A study later found that climate change had a \"profound influence\", greatly increasing the chance of underlying extreme warm and dry conditions and increasing the area burned by a factor of seven to 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This year's fire season is unique in not being isolated to a particular province, says Carly Phillips, a research scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US. What links the provinces is hotter than usual temperatures for this time of year and a prolonged period of drought, both of which raise wildfire risk and are getting worse in some places due to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Canada has incredibly diverse ecosystems,\" says Hoffman. \"And what we're seeing is drought in the prairies, in the mountainous ecosystems, in the Maritimes [provinces]. So places that maybe wouldn't have as much fire activity on a normal year, like Nova Scotia and Halifax, are now seeing many more ignitions.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "You might also like:\n",

      "Lynn Johnston, a forest fire research specialist with Natural Resources Canada, adds that the fire season started a lot earlier than usual this year in some places.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers at World Weather Attribution, who explore the connections between extreme weather and climate change, will be analysing the current Canadian wildfires but say they need to update their methodology for fires first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the genesis and spread of a wildfire is \"complicated\", however, Johnston says she is less hesitant than she used to be about making the link to climate change. Hoffman is also concerned when media reports on wildfires do not make the link to climate-induced disasters. \"The science is very much telling a different story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, they all acknowledge there are other important factors at play.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Human development into forested areas increases the risk of people or their infrastructure sparking fires, says Phillips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers have also long drawn attention to the way that Canadian forestry policies moved away from traditional and Indigenous practices of planned burning which safeguard valuable timber resources and people. Regular, controlled burning clears the forest understory and reduces the risk of larger fires spinning out of control, but this had been stopped in much of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts say that climate change intertwines with other important factors such as forest management as the \"cause\" of wildfires (Credit: Getty Images)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been a change of mindset in recent years, with forestry researchers and managers increasingly recognising that fire suppression is \"not always necessary or desirable\". Fires are more frequently left to burn in places where they do not immediately affect peoples’ lives or property, and there has been a return to planned burning in some provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the legacy of suppression, as well as the planting of more commercial but less fire-tolerant tree species, has made it easier for fires to spread. A recent IPCC summary report identifies \"fire suppression in naturally fire-adapted ecosystems\" as one of the ways in which people are adapting poorly to climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another potential cause of some of the fires increasingly being raised on social media and in some press reports is arson. One conspiracy theory circulating online even claims some of the fires were sparked by \"ecoterrorists\" trying to dramatically draw public attention to climate change or to force through a restrictive climate agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While some of these incidents are being investigated by police, researchers say there is no evidence that they are the main cause of the problem. Hoffman notes that roughly half the wildfires across Canada every year are ignited by lightning strikes, although the proportion is usually greater later in the summer. On 1 June, lightning sparked around 200 fires in Quebec overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The other half of wildfires are sparked by human activity. But this is mainly accidental, from incidents such as motor vehicle accidents, off-road vehicle ignitions, fireworks or people not putting out campfires.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most of the fires we're seeing now are caused by lightning and we know that because we have lightning strike density maps,\" says Hoffman. \"We can see the systems come in, we can see the positive cloud to ground lightning strikes and the ignitions right after. The misinformation [about arson] is really concerning because the science is very clear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Johnston adds that the number of lightning strikes appears to be rising, and that could also worsen with climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hoffman, a former firefighter, says conversations around fire management are already better than they were 20 years ago. But she thinks it vital to understand all the different factors at play in wildfires such as the Canadian ones this year, most of which are ultimately human, to be able to respond properly to them. \"Fire is coming, and it's going to get worse. We need to be better prepared for it.\"\n",

      "\n",

      "The increase in the number of extreme weather events in recent years seems to have led to some change in the developed countries’ attitude toward the global climate financing architecture. But thoughts have rarely matched action. The summit for a “Global Financial Pact on Climate Change” at Paris, last week, too asked the right questions. French President Emmanuel Macron set the tone by calling for a “public finance shock”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most other delegates agreed that multilateral institutions should find ways to unlock new climate investments and debt arrangements should include disaster clauses — a two-year pause on repayments after an extreme weather event, for example. Yet, representatives of the developing countries at the two-day summit could not help coming away with the feeling that changes in the funding ecosystem are likely to be incremental, at best, in the coming years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the positives of the meet was President Macron’s announcement that there is “a good likelihood” of the rich nations fulfilling, by the end of this year, their pledge for an $ 100 billion annual fund for climate change initiatives in the Global South. That commitment was made in 2009 and developing countries were slated to receive the funds by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The failure to honour the 14-year-old pledge has become a symbol of the failure of the global climate financing system and aggravated the atmosphere of mistrust in climate negotiations. A course correction could help mend broken fences in the run-up to the COP28 at Dubai in November when the UNFCCC will take stock of the progress — or the lack of it — towards attaining the goals of the 2015 Paris Pact.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, the enormity of the task at hand is such that $ 100 billion today represents a fraction of the amount required by the Global South to develop resilience against climate change — a report released at the COP27 last year, for instance, reckons that developing and emerging economies, other than China, will need $ 2 trillion per year by 2030 for energy transition, adaptation, sustainable agriculture and addressing global warming-related loss and damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The IMF announced special drawing rights (SDR) of $ 100 billion to the Global South; France, Japan and the UK also made SDR-related pledges. The World Bank said it will pause repayments “for countries struggling with climate disasters,” but only for repayments. These commitments do indicate a forward movement of sorts. However, any reform in the climate financing architecture shouldn’t overlook the fact that loans today constitute the major source of funds. At Paris, last week, vulnerable countries reiterated that they require grants and technology transfers. That message shouldn’t be lost.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cases of Lyme disease are on the rise in the United States and other parts of the world, and scientists believe climate change is a contributing factor. Lyme disease is a blood-borne illness transmitted by ticks to humans. It is found on all continents except Antarctica, but is most prevalent in parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. The disease causes headaches, fever, fatigue, and skin rashes. Untreated, it can affect the heart, joints, and central nervous system. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially reports about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease each year.\n",

      "Previous research demonstrated how NASA/U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data can help predict the risk of Lyme disease in high-exposure areas. Scientists at NASA’s Ames Research Center and New York Medical College combined Landsat imagery with geographic information system technology that helps manage, analyze, and visualize geographic data. They found residential areas covered by plants and trees and located adjacent to woodlands had a higher risk of Lyme disease transmission.\n",

      "Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to humans, like malaria, dengue, Zika, West Nile virus, and chikungunya. As climate warms, the reach of some mosquito-borne diseases is expanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2014 study in the journal Science found changing climate conditions are allowing mosquitoes to migrate to higher altitudes and latitudes. Climate-related droughts and extreme weather events are creating new mosquito breeding grounds. Warmer temperatures are also allowing mosquitoes to breed more quickly and for longer periods of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists are using NASA satellite data to track vegetation health, rainfall, and temperatures and monitor environmental conditions favorable to mosquitoes. This allows them to predict where mosquitoes may breed and spread illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As reported in 2017, NASA-funded researchers partnered with the Peruvian government to help forecast and prevent malaria outbreaks. They used the Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS), a land-surface modeling effort supported by NASA and other organizations that provides data and analysis on rain and snow, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation. LDAS helped researchers identify where mosquito breeding grounds were likely to form.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 24 million Americans suffer from hay fever and about 10 million suffer from asthma. Each year, weeds, grasses, and trees release massive amounts of tiny pollen spores into the air to allow the plants to reproduce. That pollen gets into our eyes, ears, noses, and throats, which makes lots of us sneeze and itch, and can make breathing especially difficult for asthma sufferers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels are causing plants to bloom earlier and produce pollen longer each year. This is leading to more pollen in the air and a longer allergy season. A 2012 study found longer growing seasons may cause U.S. pollen levels to more than double by 2040.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A University of Maryland-led team investigated how changes in the timing of spring's arrival affected asthma hospitalizations. They used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, derived from NASA satellite observations, to determine the arrival of spring by showing the relative “greenness” of vegetation. The early onset of spring (10 days early) was linked with a 17% increase in Maryland asthma hospitalizations from 2001 to 2012.\n",

      "“Superbugs” are viruses and bacteria immune to antibiotics and antiviral medications. They’re a nightmare for microbiologists and doctors, but especially so for the patients infected with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As our planet warms, scientists are concerned that the thawing of frozen Arctic soils (permafrost) may re-introduce diseases from ancient microorganisms that have been locked away in a frozen, dormant state for a million years or longer. A single gram of permafrost soil can contain thousands of microbial species. Some of these viruses, microbes, and bacteria could be resistant to antibiotics. Scientists worry antibiotic-resistant permafrost organisms could exchange genetic material with modern bacteria, creating superbugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent NASA-led research has cataloged these potential hazards. A study led by Kimberley Miner of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory examined the biological, chemical, and radioactive materials stored in ice, snow, and permafrost. The researchers noted that re-introducing ancient microorganisms back into the Arctic environment could disrupt ecosystems, kill wildlife, and put human health at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies show about two-thirds of permafrost near the Arctic land surface may thaw by 2100. More than three million people live on permafrost in Earth’s high northern latitudes, and Arctic commerce, resource extraction, tourism, and populations are rising. This increases the risk humans may be exposed to emerging hazards and then transport them globally.\n",

      "Heat already kills more people in the United States than any other climaterelated hazard According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention an average of 702 heatrelated deaths and 9235 heatrelated hospitalizations occur annually Many surmise that these are significantly underreported because of the oversight or misclassification of heatrelated illnesses and deaths in medical records A 2021 study estimated that heat led to around 12000 premature deaths in the US during the 2010s\n",

      "“Heat deaths don’t have the drama of tornado deaths or hurricane deaths or flooding deaths So it’s often referred to as the silent killer of climate change” says Andrew Hurley a historian at the University of MissouriSt Louis who researches climate change and urban development\n",

      "“So you do have people that die of heat stroke which comes on after prolonged exposure but then you also have people with underlying conditions who are vulnerable to begin with So they may suffer death from heart attack that is exacerbated by the stress on the body when the temperature goes up Those aren’t recorded as heat deaths but they’re very real” Hurley says\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That said heatrelated illness and deaths have declined dramatically across the country and in Missouri in recent decades in large part due to the proliferation of air conditioning\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s probably the most dramatic historical change in how urban populations have adapted to hot weather” Hurley says According to US census data from 2011 more than 90 of housing units in St Louis have central air conditioning\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hurley thinks disparities in terms of people’s ability to survive extremely hot weather have grown alongside air conditioning He says that before air conditioning became commonplace people sought refuge from the heat outside often in collective green spaces like parks Now they stay indoors\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The positive result has been fewer heatrelated deaths but the negative has been the loss of social interaction provided by people congregating in green spaces And air conditioning has a much worse environmental impact\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more Hurley says air conditioning varies in quality\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we often find in terms of people who have died in recent heat waves is they’ve had air conditioning” he says But their air conditioning was old and not working well or they were worried about their electric bills so they didn’t turn it on\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor people and people of color who tend to be poorer were always more vulnerable to heat across time” Hurley says “But I think it’s intensified since the era of air conditioning”\n",

      "\n",
      "“It was pretty remarkable what we found” Shandas says The analysis showed that formerly redlined areas were on average about 5 degrees hotter than their nonredlined counterparts\n",

      "\n",
      "In the city of St Louis the temperature difference was of 47 degrees “which is higher than many of the cities that we’ve seen and it was a very clear signal that St Louis has actually got areas that have much much hotter redlined neighborhoods today even though redlining is no longer part of our official federal policy” he says\n",

      "\n",
      "They also found that the redlined areas — which include north city and some parts of south city to the east of Tower Grove Park — lacked tree canopy and were replete with impervious surfaces like concrete and asphalt as well as “landhungry development” made of dense materials that absorb and reemit heat\n",

      "\n",

      "A final consideration around feasibility is that the thresholds are not immutable laws—indeed some historical cases prove that the chosen thresholds can be overcome Two examples are the surge of gasfired power in the Netherlands and nuclear power in France which respectively surged from 5 to 80 and 25 to 75 of the power mix in one decade surpassing the applied feasibility threshold in this study over tenfold Since such historical examples of fast transitions are typically driven by public policy and support48 the feasibility analysis can also be interpreted as a mapping exercise of where policy support is strongly needed to overcome existing constraints which is crucial for achieving stated climate targets as all models and scenarios in this study surpass several feasibility thresholds Nevertheless as the results show this mapping strongly depends on the applied model deep structural differences between models lead to a wide variety of pathways reaching the same climate targets and hence different policy interventions are necessary from different modelling perspectives to make these pathways feasible\n",

      "Accounting for post2030 extrapolations of current policies and NDCs this study shows substantially lower emissions and endofcentury temperatures than other studies additionally our multimodel LTT projections are slightly more optimistic by 01 °C An important reason for this difference probably lies in the applied extrapolation method in contrast to a continued trend in emission intensities used in this study other studies applied a carbon price equivalent to 2030 action and increasing over time with GDP levels23272829 a method leading to more conservative emissions reductions in most models18 There is no straightforward answer on which policy extrapolation method is better while continuing a trend in emissions reductions may falsely bank on an emissions reduction trend that might not be equally attainable in the future relying on extrapolated carbon prices may put too much faith in highly uncertain future model assumptions especially considering that for example the decline in costs of lowcarbon technologies have traditionally been underestimated in such assumptions12 Another important difference with several other model studies in the literature is that current policies are modelled explicitly that is not proxied via carbon prices until 2030 Supplementary Data and on top of an uptodate harmonized set of socioeconomic and technoeconomic assumptions This contributes to the relatively optimistic assessment of 2030 emissions in the study as it endogenously assumes ratcheting of emissions reduction targets by overperforming on these targets where these are not ambitious\n",

      "In the 1500s the artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder produced a painting about peoples indifference to distant suffering Called Landscape with the Fall of Icarus a copy of the original thats now on display in Brussels shows a farmer ploughing his field in the foreground Its only when you look carefully that you can see Icarus drowning in the sea in the distance surrounded by melted feathers his legs flailing in the air\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a decade ago the psychologists Nira Liberman and Yaacov Trope used Bruegels painting to introduce an idea in the journal Science that describes how time and distance shape peoples attitudes – and specifically their empathy towards others They called it construal level theory The farmer is indifferent to the plight of Icarus they argued because he is far away With geographical distance comes psychological distance\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Its an idea that holds particular relevance this week as the east coast of North America experiences low air quality and dystopian orange skies due to wildfires in Canada Some on social media – notably quite a few Californians who have already faced such impacts – have speculated that the pollution may sharpen the realities of climate change for many east coasters Could it change hearts and minds they wonder because the impacts are so close to home Others pointed to the symbolism of the United Nations building in New York City shrouded in smog\n",

      "\n",

      "According to construal level theory peoples awareness and willingness to act on climate change should in principle be influenced by how psychologically close they perceive its impacts to be If they formerly believed climate change was mainly about melting ice caps drought in the developing world or disappearing island nations – and all those are far away in space and time – then their concern should be lower In 2011 one psychologist referred to psychological distance as one of the dragons of inaction for preventing climate change\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This isnt necessarily callous behaviour according to psychologists In Bruegels painting the farmer has more immediate needs and priorities – perhaps hes intent on feeding his own family – so its harder to notice and extend empathy towards Icaruss suffering in the ocean far away Peoples circle of concern is often drawn near to them meaning that they will care more about someone close to home rather than on the opposite side of the world\n",

      "However on reviewing the literature up to 2020 the psychologist Roberta Maiella of G dAnnunzio University of ChietiPescara in Italy and colleagues found that the reality was more complex and nuanced than first appears\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is indeed evidence that proximity to climate impacts influences peoples views For example in 2011 Alexa Spence of the University of Nottingham and colleagues surveyed UK residents exposed to coastal flooding and found that they perceived greater uncertainty about the climate and more willingness to restrict energy use And another study of participants in 24 countries showed that people with personal experience of climate change were more likely to do things like use less air conditioning in the summer\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However not all studies have confirmed the correlation as strong and the methodologies to study the effect differ In one study where US participants were presented with the impact of climate change in the Maldives researchers used cues that aimed to reduce peoples psychological distance and make the remote island nation feel nearer This included asking them to trace the distance from Ithaca in New York to the remote island nation on a map and watch a video about how sea level rise was affecting Maldives citizens People given these cues judged the Maldives to be spatially closer but crucially this didnt translate into increased support for climate change mitigation policies\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Peoples prior political affiliation may also matter One 2020 study of Californians’ response to nearby wildfires suggested that close exposure to damage fostered support for proenvironmental policies in Democratic areas but not Republican ones\n",

      "So will the awful air and darkened skies in New York City and other east coast cities influence peoples attitudes there Perhaps for some – but there are clearly other effects at play that influence beliefs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There do seem to be ways to reduce psychological distance over climate change through effective communication For instance theres a wellknown trick that charities often use called the identifiable victim effect When people are presented with a single human being facing the effects of climate change this can foster greater empathy In one study by psychologists Sabine Pahl at the University of Plymouth and Judith Bauer at the University of Erlangen in Germany people were told a detailed story about a woman living in the future facing the impact of climate change The pair told people how shed burn her skin outside in the Sun or get a rash after swimming in a polluted sea Compared with those who had been given more factfocused information about future warming people who heard the womans story were more likely to spend time reading about climate change afterwards\n",

      "PORTLAND Ore AP — A jury verdict that found an Oregon power company liable for devastating wildfires — and potentially billions of dollars in damages — is highlighting the legal and financial risks utilities take if they fail to take proper precautions in a hotter drier climate\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Utilities especially in the US West are increasingly finding themselves in a financial bind that’s partly of their own making experts say While updating replacing and even burying thousands of miles of power lines is a timeconsuming and costly undertaking the failure to start that work in earnest years ago has put them on the back foot as wildfires have grown more destructive — and lawsuits over electrical equipment sparking blazes have ballooned\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do they pay for that and at the same time try to do grid hardening at a pace that could prevent the need for constant shutting down of the power” Josh Hacker chief science officer at Jupiter Intelligence a company that provides advice on managing climate change risks said of lawsuit damages “This is an enormous challenge Now it’s biting them And in the end it’s going to bite all of us because they have to recover that expense”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week a jury in Oregon found PacifiCorp liable for damages for negligently failing to cut power to its 600000 customers during a windstorm over Labor Day weekend despite warnings from top fire officials and for its power lines being responsible for multiple blazes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PacifiCorp said it was disappointed with the jury’s decision and that it plans to appeal\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The fires were among the worst natural disasters in Oregon’s history They killed nine people burned more than 1875 square miles 4856 square kilometers and destroyed upward of 5000 homes and other structures While total damages remain to be determined they are expected to reach into the billions\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because utilities make money from customers they often raise revenue for infrastructure upgrades by hiking rates In California for example Pacific Gas and Electric has requested to increase its rates for residential customers this year by roughly 18 partly to bury more than 3000 miles 4828 kilometers of overhead power lines underground according to a fact sheet from the state’s public utilities commission The commission which regulates utility rates said it expects to make a final decision on the request between July and September\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PGE’s planned upgrades come amid heightened scrutiny of the utility which serves more than 16 million people over 70000 square miles 181300 square kilometers in central and northern California Facing billions of dollars in damages stemming from multiple blazes it filed for bankruptcy in 2019 shortly after its neglected equipment caused a fire that virtually razed the town of Paradise in the Sierra Nevada foothills in 2018 The Camp Fire was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California’s history\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PGE’s bankruptcy settlement with wildfire victims was an eyepopping 135 billion Only half of the money was paid to victims in cash while the other half was paid out in PGE stock which has since declined in value\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PacifiCorp meanwhile says it has invested hundreds of millions of dollars since the Labor Day 2020 fires in Oregon in upgrading its equipment and expanding its weather stations and weather modeling But customers are also helping fund those investments Oregon’s public utility commission approved rate increases for PacifiCorp in 2023 in part so that the utility could cover “nonenergy costs” including wildfire mitigation and vegetation management \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After the verdicts were handed down PacifiCorp filed a request with Oregon’s public utility commission asking to potentially defer the costs linked to the lawsuit The jury awarded around 90 million to 17 homeowners named as plaintiffs in the case with damages to be determined later for a broader class that could include the owners of about 2500 properties as estimated by plaintiffs’ attorneys\n",

      "In the United States in 2017 people of color were exposed to 10 more particulate matter air pollution compared to white people This welldocumented inequity has been baked into the fabric of American life by racist housing policies like redlining and has left a legacy of negative health outcomes for communities of color across the nation \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind of sweeping cuts to greenhouse gas emissions needed to fight climate change are expected to improve air quality because burning fossil fuels also produces air pollution But a new study from researchers at the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography and School of Global Policy and Strategy shows that while reducing greenhouse gases will likely improve overall air quality reducing emissions could maintain or even exacerbate environmental inequality\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and supported by the National Science Foundation as well as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation used computer models to simulate more than 300 paths to reduce emissions that all achieved the US Paris Climate Agreement goal of a 5052 net greenhouse gas emissions reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 While all the simulated paths to reducing emissions improved overall air quality some actually widened the air quality gap between people of color and white people in the US\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“These disparities can go up or down depending on how you implement climate policy” said climate scientist Pascal Polonik 2023 Scripps PhD graduate and lead author of the study “It’s not a given that any climate policy that succeeds in reducing emissions also succeeds when it comes to environmental justice”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example a simulation that prioritized emissions reductions in neighborhoods with low household income showed increased air pollution inequality as did a simulation that achieved the cuts needed for the US to meet its Paris Agreement goals in the cheapest way possible\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Polonik said the study’s investigation of how the distribution of air quality might change under different climate policies was spurred by statements from the Biden administration that linked climate change and environmental justice including the IRA and a 2021 executive order\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To explore this question Polonik and his coauthors started with the US national emissions inventory from 2017 Because pollutants which are damaging to human health are often released alongside greenhouse gases the team was able to use this national emissions inventory and a computer model to create a map of air pollution in the US under different climate policy implementations\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the Paris Agreement emissions reduction goal the team created a set of five reduction pathways based on different organizing principles These five pathways reduced emissions by making equal cuts across the country by focusing on lowincome neighborhoods by achieving the emissions cuts in the least costly way possible by prioritizing communities of color and by reducing emissions in the places with the worst air quality\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To represent an even wider array of potential climate policy scenarios the researchers also ran an additional 300 computer simulations that randomized where the greenhouse gas reductions came from\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next the team took these 305 scenarios and plugged the geographic distribution of their associated emissions reductions into an air quality model that could estimate how they would impact air pollution across the country\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Polonik and his colleagues established the geographic air pollution consequences of each climate policy scenario they could use census tract data to layer demographic information onto the map and then calculate how each scenario impacted the racial disparities compared to the unaltered data from 2017 For the randomized simulations the team conducted additional statistical analyses to tease out which variables had the greatest impact on the outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While no pathway completely eliminated the historical racial inequities that influence air pollution exposure they all reduced the overall burden of air pollution Two scenarios that are particularly relevant to realworld climate policy however exacerbated racial inequities The emissions reduction simulation that prioritized lowincome areas increased air pollution inequality by 02 percentage points and the simulation that achieved emissions reductions at the lowest cost increased inequality by 05 percentage points\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The US government has at times tried to use income as a way of targeting communities of color without using race or ethnicity as policy criteria” said coauthor Kate Ricke assistant professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Scripps “Our results show how that approach can fall short when it comes to environmental justice”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The relevance of the lowest cost approach especially in view of the dramatic emissions cuts needed to meet the US Paris Agreement goals is more obvious This pathway’s estimated cost was 190 billion compared with the most expensive pathway which costs 340 billion \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“To some degree the US might naturally prioritize what’s economically efficient” said coauthor Jennifer Burney an environmental scientist at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Scripps “But if you take an entirely economical approach to reducing emissions our study suggests that it wont just fail to rectify existing racial and ethnic exposure inequalities it could exacerbate them”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The only scenario that enhanced environmental equity across all groups was the one that prioritized emissions reductions in communities of color which reduced racial inequality by 26 percentage points However the US government is unlikely to use race to target disadvantaged communities in climate policy due to the risk of legal challenges according to Polonik \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathway that targeted locations with the most air pollution also reduced overall racial inequality by 11 but actually increased the air pollution disparity for Hispanic communities The scenario with equal emissions reductions across the country reduced racial inequality by 01 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally the analysis of the 300 randomized pathways revealed that greenhouse gas reductions coming from the transportation sector had the greatest potential to reduce racial disparities in air pollution\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Climate policy can absolutely be used to reduce inequity in air pollution exposure” said Polonik “But naive implementation of climate policy doesn’t necessarily improve environmental equity so it’s vital to adopt an approach to reducing emissions that explicitly factors in environmental justice”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Polonik said that an explanation of why prioritizing emissions reductions in lowincome areas or why taking the cheapest approach to reducing emissions ended up increasing racial air pollution disparities was beyond the scope of this study\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“These racial inequities are deeply ingrained and have been around for a long time” said Polonik “You can reduce emissions in a lot of different ways and this pattern will remain If you’re not specifically targeting environmental inequality it’s likely to persist”\n",

      "Pakistan like many countries around the world is grappling with the profound challenges posed by climate change As a developing nation highly vulnerable to its impacts Pakistan faces a range of environmental social and economic consequences that demand immediate attention The time has come for a collective and urgent effort to combat climate change in Pakistan as failure to act decisively will only exacerbate the existing challenges and jeopardize the future of the nation\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most pressing concerns in Pakistan is the rising temperature leading to extreme heat waves and longer more intense periods of drought These changes directly affect agriculture the backbone of Pakistan’s economy leading to crop failures and food insecurity for millions of people Additionally the melting glaciers in the Himalayas pose a severe threat as they feed the country’s major rivers and any disruption in their flow would exacerbate the already critical water scarcity issue\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate the impact of climate change Pakistan must prioritize the transition to renewable energy sources The nation has a vast potential for solar and wind energy which remains largely untapped By investing in renewable energy infrastructure Pakistan can reduce its reliance on fossil fuels decrease greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development Moreover such a transition would create job opportunities boost the economy and enhance energy security in the long run\n",

      "Pakistan boasts diverse ecosystems including unique forests wetlands and coastal areas which are home to a rich array of flora and fauna However climate change poses a grave threat to this biodiversity It is crucial to establish protected areas conserve forests and promote sustainable forestry practices Reforestation initiatives should be prioritized to combat deforestation and enhance carbon sequestration Moreover by preserving natural habitats Pakistan can safeguard its natural resources and promote ecotourism contributing to both conservation and economic growth\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing climate change requires collaboration at the international level Pakistan should actively engage in global efforts such as the Paris Agreement and seek financial and technical assistance for climate adaptation and mitigation projects Domestically the government must establish and enforce comprehensive climate change policies promoting renewable energy adoption sustainable agriculture practices and emission reduction targets Public awareness campaigns and educational programs can also play a pivotal role in fostering a culture of environmental stewardship\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change poses an existential threat to Pakistan’s future affecting all aspects of society Addressing this challenge requires immediate action strong political will and the involvement of all stakeholders By embracing renewable energy implementing sustainable urban planning protecting biodiversity and collaborating internationally Pakistan can pave the way for a more resilient and sustainable future Let us come together transcend boundaries and take the necessary steps to safeguard our planet and secure a better tomorrow for generations to come\n",

      "WASHINGTON AP — America’s honeybee hives just staggered through the second highest death rate on record with beekeepers losing nearly half of their managed colonies an annual bee survey found\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But using costly and Herculean measures to create new colonies beekeepers are somehow keeping afloat Thursday’s University of Maryland and Auburn University survey found that even though 48 of colonies were lost in the year that ended April 1 the number of United States honeybee colonies “remained relatively stable”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeybees are crucial to the food supply pollinating more than 100 of the crops we eat including nuts vegetables berries citrus and melons Scientists said a combination of parasites pesticides starvation and climate change keep causing large dieoffs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year’s 48 annual loss is up from the previous year’s loss of 39 and the 12year average of 396 but it’s not as high as 20202021’s 508 mortality rate according to the survey funded and administered by the nonprofit research group Bee Informed Partnership Beekeepers told the surveying scientists that 21 loss over the winter is acceptable and more than threefifths of beekeepers surveyed said their losses were higher than that\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a very troubling loss number when we barely manage sufficient colonies to meet pollination demands in the US” said former government bee scientist Jeff Pettis president of the global beekeeper association Apimondia that wasn’t part of the study “It also highlights the hard work that beekeepers must do to rebuild their colony numbers each year”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall bee colony population is relatively steady because commercial beekeepers split and restock their hives finding or buying new queens or even starter packs for colonies said University of Maryland bee researcher Nathalie Steinhauer the survey’s lead author It’s an expensive and time consuming process \n",

      "The prognosis is not as bad as 15 years ago because beekeepers have learned how to rebound from big losses she said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The situation is not really getting worse but it’s also not really getting better” Steinhauer said “It is not a bee apocalypse”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite big annual losses the situation is a far cry from 2007 when many bee experts expected an end to managed pollination said US Department Agriculture research entomologist Jay Evans who wasn’t part of the survey\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are threats certainly in the environment and honeybees have persisted” Evans said “I don’t think honeybees will go extinct but I think they will always have these sort of challenges”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some commercial beekeepers who have succeeded in the past lost as much as 80 of their colonies this past year while other beekeepers did well it varied so much Evans said Pettis who has 150 colonies on Maryland’s Eastern shore had less than 18 loss saying he used organic acids for mite control\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The parasitic mite Varroa destructor that helps transmit viruses is the chief culprit but bad weather and queen issues were also big problems in the past year Steinhauer said Pesticides also make things worse because it makes bees more vulnerable to diseases and less likely to seek food she said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It really can be like death by a thousand cuts with the most obvious one being varroa” Steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The mite varroa is a flat creature that crawls on the bee – it would be the equivalent of a frisbee or flat softball on human bodies – Evans said The mite seems to make it easier for viruses to attack and kill bees he and Steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It used to take large amounts of varroa such as in 60 of a colony to cause virus problems but now even small infestations at 1 or 2 in a colony can cause massive problems Steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are fighting this evolving enemy” Steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem is landscapes that have only one crop or homogenous landscapes which deprive bees of food while pesticides and bouts of extreme weather also have caused problems\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For example in the Washington DC area unusual 80degree warmth in January brought some bees out of their normal winter routine and then when it turned cool again they had problems Evans said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The impact of climate change on bee colony survival is real and can go undetected” Pettis said in an email\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The demand for pollination from commercial bee colonies is growing even as the beekeepers have to work harder to make up for losses Steinhauer said The US Department of Agriculture says 35 of the human diet comes from insectpollinated plants and the honeybee is responsible for 80 of that pollination\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is this whole side of our agricultural industry that relies on these colonies” Steinhauer said “And the fact that every year the commercial beekeepers have to invest so much more effort to keep those numbers up because they have to fulfill those pollination contracts puts a lot of stress on those beekeepers and the bees” \n",

      "\n",
      "The Associated Press reached out to several Saudi officials with detailed questions but received no response It’s unclear what if any studies the government has done on the environmental impact of the pilgrimage or whether that figures into its plans And wellintentioned measures like a highspeed railway network aren’t enough to remove polluting traffic in and around the holy city \n",

      "The trains whip through the arid landscape at top speeds of 300 kmh 186 mph carrying pilgrims in airconditioned comfort from Jeddah to Mecca But they stop several kilometers away from the Grand Mosque meaning pilgrims must either walk at least an hour or take a bus or car to the holy site The 19 oneway price from Jeddah’s airport to Mecca may also be out of reach for pilgrims on lower incomes\n",

      "Researchers have also long drawn attention to the way that Canadian forestry policies moved away from traditional and Indigenous practices of planned burning which safeguard valuable timber resources and people Regular controlled burning clears the forest understory and reduces the risk of larger fires spinning out of control but this had been stopped in much of the country\n",

      "While some of these incidents are being investigated by police researchers say there is no evidence that they are the main cause of the problem Hoffman notes that roughly half the wildfires across Canada every year are ignited by lightning strikes although the proportion is usually greater later in the summer On 1 June lightning sparked around 200 fires in Quebec overnight\n",
      "\n",

      "The other half of wildfires are sparked by human activity But this is mainly accidental from incidents such as motor vehicle accidents offroad vehicle ignitions fireworks or people not putting out campfires\n",

      "Most of the fires were seeing now are caused by lightning and we know that because we have lightning strike density maps says Hoffman We can see the systems come in we can see the positive cloud to ground lightning strikes and the ignitions right after The misinformation about arson is really concerning because the science is very clear\n",

      "The increase in the number of extreme weather events in recent years seems to have led to some change in the developed countries’ attitude toward the global climate financing architecture But thoughts have rarely matched action The summit for a “Global Financial Pact on Climate Change” at Paris last week too asked the right questions French President Emmanuel Macron set the tone by calling for a “public finance shock”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most other delegates agreed that multilateral institutions should find ways to unlock new climate investments and debt arrangements should include disaster clauses — a twoyear pause on repayments after an extreme weather event for example Yet representatives of the developing countries at the twoday summit could not help coming away with the feeling that changes in the funding ecosystem are likely to be incremental at best in the coming years\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the positives of the meet was President Macron’s announcement that there is “a good likelihood” of the rich nations fulfilling by the end of this year their pledge for an  100 billion annual fund for climate change initiatives in the Global South That commitment was made in 2009 and developing countries were slated to receive the funds by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The failure to honour the 14yearold pledge has become a symbol of the failure of the global climate financing system and aggravated the atmosphere of mistrust in climate negotiations A course correction could help mend broken fences in the runup to the COP28 at Dubai in November when the UNFCCC will take stock of the progress — or the lack of it — towards attaining the goals of the 2015 Paris Pact\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the enormity of the task at hand is such that  100 billion today represents a fraction of the amount required by the Global South to develop resilience against climate change — a report released at the COP27 last year for instance reckons that developing and emerging economies other than China will need  2 trillion per year by 2030 for energy transition adaptation sustainable agriculture and addressing global warmingrelated loss and damage\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The IMF announced special drawing rights SDR of  100 billion to the Global South France Japan and the UK also made SDRrelated pledges The World Bank said it will pause repayments “for countries struggling with climate disasters” but only for repayments These commitments do indicate a forward movement of sorts However any reform in the climate financing architecture shouldn’t overlook the fact that loans today constitute the major source of funds At Paris last week vulnerable countries reiterated that they require grants and technology transfers That message shouldn’t be lost\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cases of Lyme disease are on the rise in the United States and other parts of the world and scientists believe climate change is a contributing factor Lyme disease is a bloodborne illness transmitted by ticks to humans It is found on all continents except Antarctica but is most prevalent in parts of North America Europe and Asia The disease causes headaches fever fatigue and skin rashes Untreated it can affect the heart joints and central nervous system The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially reports about 30000 cases of Lyme disease each year\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers recently found that the risk of Lyme disease is expanding north in Canada This is happening as global temperatures warm and areas become more habitable to ticks The scientists combined NASA satellite data with field data of tick surveillance and weather station data to predict habitats suitable to deer ticks  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous research demonstrated how NASAUS Geological Survey Landsat satellite data can help predict the risk of Lyme disease in highexposure areas Scientists at NASA’s Ames Research Center and New York Medical College combined Landsat imagery with geographic information system technology that helps manage analyze and visualize geographic data They found residential areas covered by plants and trees and located adjacent to woodlands had a higher risk of Lyme disease transmission\n",

      "A 2014 study in the journal Science found changing climate conditions are allowing mosquitoes to migrate to higher altitudes and latitudes Climaterelated droughts and extreme weather events are creating new mosquito breeding grounds Warmer temperatures are also allowing mosquitoes to breed more quickly and for longer periods of time\n",

      "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 24 million Americans suffer from hay fever and about 10 million suffer from asthma Each year weeds grasses and trees release massive amounts of tiny pollen spores into the air to allow the plants to reproduce That pollen gets into our eyes ears noses and throats which makes lots of us sneeze and itch and can make breathing especially difficult for asthma sufferers\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Warmer temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels are causing plants to bloom earlier and produce pollen longer each year This is leading to more pollen in the air and a longer allergy season A 2012 study found longer growing seasons may cause US pollen levels to more than double by 2040\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A University of Marylandled team investigated how changes in the timing of springs arrival affected asthma hospitalizations They used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from NASA satellite observations to determine the arrival of spring by showing the relative “greenness” of vegetation The early onset of spring 10 days early was linked with a 17 increase in Maryland asthma hospitalizations from 2001 to 2012\n",

      "\n",
      "As our planet warms scientists are concerned that the thawing of frozen Arctic soils permafrost may reintroduce diseases from ancient microorganisms that have been locked away in a frozen dormant state for a million years or longer A single gram of permafrost soil can contain thousands of microbial species Some of these viruses microbes and bacteria could be resistant to antibiotics Scientists worry antibioticresistant permafrost organisms could exchange genetic material with modern bacteria creating superbugs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent NASAled research has cataloged these potential hazards A study led by Kimberley Miner of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory examined the biological chemical and radioactive materials stored in ice snow and permafrost The researchers noted that reintroducing ancient microorganisms back into the Arctic environment could disrupt ecosystems kill wildlife and put human health at risk\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies show about twothirds of permafrost near the Arctic land surface may thaw by 2100 More than three million people live on permafrost in Earth’s high northern latitudes and Arctic commerce resource extraction tourism and populations are rising This increases the risk humans may be exposed to emerging hazards and then transport them globally\n",

      "in the 1500s the artist pieter bruegel the elder produced a painting about peoples indifference to distant suffering called landscape with the fall of icarus a copy of the original thats now on display in brussels shows a farmer ploughing his field in the foreground its only when you look carefully that you can see icarus drowning in the sea in the distance surrounded by melted feathers his legs flailing in the air\n",

      "more than a decade ago the psychologists nira liberman and yaacov trope used bruegels painting to introduce an idea in the journal science that describes how time and distance shape peoples attitudes – and specifically their empathy towards others they called it construal level theory the farmer is indifferent to the plight of icarus they argued because he is far away with geographical distance comes psychological distance\n",

      "its an idea that holds particular relevance this week as the east coast of north america experiences low air quality and dystopian orange skies due to wildfires in canada some on social media – notably quite a few californians who have already faced such impacts – have speculated that the pollution may sharpen the realities of climate change for many east coasters could it change hearts and minds they wonder because the impacts are so close to home others pointed to the symbolism of the united nations building in new york city shrouded in smog\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this isnt necessarily callous behaviour according to psychologists in bruegels painting the farmer has more immediate needs and priorities – perhaps hes intent on feeding his own family – so its harder to notice and extend empathy towards icaruss suffering in the ocean far away peoples circle of concern is often drawn near to them meaning that they will care more about someone close to home rather than on the opposite side of the world\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "there is indeed evidence that proximity to climate impacts influences peoples views for example in 2011 alexa spence of the university of nottingham and colleagues surveyed uk residents exposed to coastal flooding and found that they perceived greater uncertainty about the climate and more willingness to restrict energy use and another study of participants in 24 countries showed that people with personal experience of climate change were more likely to do things like use less air conditioning in the summer\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "however not all studies have confirmed the correlation as strong and the methodologies to study the effect differ in one study where us participants were presented with the impact of climate change in the maldives researchers used cues that aimed to reduce peoples psychological distance and make the remote island nation feel nearer this included asking them to trace the distance from ithaca in new york to the remote island nation on a map and watch a video about how sea level rise was affecting maldives citizens people given these cues judged the maldives to be spatially closer but crucially this didnt translate into increased support for climate change mitigation policies\n",

      "there do seem to be ways to reduce psychological distance over climate change through effective communication for instance theres a wellknown trick that charities often use called the identifiable victim effect when people are presented with a single human being facing the effects of climate change this can foster greater empathy in one study by psychologists sabine pahl at the university of plymouth and judith bauer at the university of erlangen in germany people were told a detailed story about a woman living in the future facing the impact of climate change the pair told people how shed burn her skin outside in the sun or get a rash after swimming in a polluted sea compared with those who had been given more factfocused information about future warming people who heard the womans story were more likely to spend time reading about climate change afterwards\n",

      "for example a simulation that prioritized emissions reductions in neighborhoods with low household income showed increased air pollution inequality as did a simulation that achieved the cuts needed for the us to meet its paris agreement goals in the cheapest way possible\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "polonik said the study’s investigation of how the distribution of air quality might change under different climate policies was spurred by statements from the biden administration that linked climate change and environmental justice including the ira and a 2021 executive order\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to explore this question polonik and his coauthors started with the us national emissions inventory from 2017 because pollutants which are damaging to human health are often released alongside greenhouse gases the team was able to use this national emissions inventory and a computer model to create a map of air pollution in the us under different climate policy implementations\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "using the paris agreement emissions reduction goal the team created a set of five reduction pathways based on different organizing principles these five pathways reduced emissions by making equal cuts across the country by focusing on lowincome neighborhoods by achieving the emissions cuts in the least costly way possible by prioritizing communities of color and by reducing emissions in the places with the worst air quality\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to represent an even wider array of potential climate policy scenarios the researchers also ran an additional 300 computer simulations that randomized where the greenhouse gas reductions came from\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "next the team took these 305 scenarios and plugged the geographic distribution of their associated emissions reductions into an air quality model that could estimate how they would impact air pollution across the country\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "once polonik and his colleagues established the geographic air pollution consequences of each climate policy scenario they could use census tract data to layer demographic information onto the map and then calculate how each scenario impacted the racial disparities compared to the unaltered data from 2017 for the randomized simulations the team conducted additional statistical analyses to tease out which variables had the greatest impact on the outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "while no pathway completely eliminated the historical racial inequities that influence air pollution exposure they all reduced the overall burden of air pollution two scenarios that are particularly relevant to realworld climate policy however exacerbated racial inequities the emissions reduction simulation that prioritized lowincome areas increased air pollution inequality by 02 percentage points and the simulation that achieved emissions reductions at the lowest cost increased inequality by 05 percentage points\n",

      "“the us government has at times tried to use income as a way of targeting communities of color without using race or ethnicity as policy criteria” said coauthor kate ricke assistant professor at the school of global policy and strategy and scripps “our results show how that approach can fall short when it comes to environmental justice”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the relevance of the lowest cost approach especially in view of the dramatic emissions cuts needed to meet the us paris agreement goals is more obvious this pathway’s estimated cost was 190 billion compared with the most expensive pathway which costs 340 billion \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“to some degree the us might naturally prioritize what’s economically efficient” said coauthor jennifer burney an environmental scientist at the school of global policy and strategy and scripps “but if you take an entirely economical approach to reducing emissions our study suggests that it wont just fail to rectify existing racial and ethnic exposure inequalities it could exacerbate them”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the only scenario that enhanced environmental equity across all groups was the one that prioritized emissions reductions in communities of color which reduced racial inequality by 26 percentage points however the us government is unlikely to use race to target disadvantaged communities in climate policy due to the risk of legal challenges according to polonik \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the pathway that targeted locations with the most air pollution also reduced overall racial inequality by 11 but actually increased the air pollution disparity for hispanic communities the scenario with equal emissions reductions across the country reduced racial inequality by 01 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "finally the analysis of the 300 randomized pathways revealed that greenhouse gas reductions coming from the transportation sector had the greatest potential to reduce racial disparities in air pollution\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“climate policy can absolutely be used to reduce inequity in air pollution exposure” said polonik “but naive implementation of climate policy doesn’t necessarily improve environmental equity so it’s vital to adopt an approach to reducing emissions that explicitly factors in environmental justice”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "polonik said that an explanation of why prioritizing emissions reductions in lowincome areas or why taking the cheapest approach to reducing emissions ended up increasing racial air pollution disparities was beyond the scope of this study\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“these racial inequities are deeply ingrained and have been around for a long time” said polonik “you can reduce emissions in a lot of different ways and this pattern will remain if you’re not specifically targeting environmental inequality it’s likely to persist”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the most pressing concerns in pakistan is the rising temperature leading to extreme heat waves and longer more intense periods of drought these changes directly affect agriculture the backbone of pakistan’s economy leading to crop failures and food insecurity for millions of people additionally the melting glaciers in the himalayas pose a severe threat as they feed the country’s major rivers and any disruption in their flow would exacerbate the already critical water scarcity issue\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to mitigate the impact of climate change pakistan must prioritize the transition to renewable energy sources the nation has a vast potential for solar and wind energy which remains largely untapped by investing in renewable energy infrastructure pakistan can reduce its reliance on fossil fuels decrease greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development moreover such a transition would create job opportunities boost the economy and enhance energy security in the long run\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "addressing climate change requires collaboration at the international level pakistan should actively engage in global efforts such as the paris agreement and seek financial and technical assistance for climate adaptation and mitigation projects domestically the government must establish and enforce comprehensive climate change policies promoting renewable energy adoption sustainable agriculture practices and emission reduction targets public awareness campaigns and educational programs can also play a pivotal role in fostering a culture of environmental stewardship\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "washington ap — america’s honeybee hives just staggered through the second highest death rate on record with beekeepers losing nearly half of their managed colonies an annual bee survey found\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "but using costly and herculean measures to create new colonies beekeepers are somehow keeping afloat thursday’s university of maryland and auburn university survey found that even though 48 of colonies were lost in the year that ended april 1 the number of united states honeybee colonies “remained relatively stable”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "honeybees are crucial to the food supply pollinating more than 100 of the crops we eat including nuts vegetables berries citrus and melons scientists said a combination of parasites pesticides starvation and climate change keep causing large dieoffs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "last year’s 48 annual loss is up from the previous year’s loss of 39 and the 12year average of 396 but it’s not as high as 20202021’s 508 mortality rate according to the survey funded and administered by the nonprofit research group bee informed partnership beekeepers told the surveying scientists that 21 loss over the winter is acceptable and more than threefifths of beekeepers surveyed said their losses were higher than that\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“this is a very troubling loss number when we barely manage sufficient colonies to meet pollination demands in the us” said former government bee scientist jeff pettis president of the global beekeeper association apimondia that wasn’t part of the study “it also highlights the hard work that beekeepers must do to rebuild their colony numbers each year”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the overall bee colony population is relatively steady because commercial beekeepers split and restock their hives finding or buying new queens or even starter packs for colonies said university of maryland bee researcher nathalie steinhauer the survey’s lead author it’s an expensive and time consuming process \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "a colony of bees are visible at a hive in the backyard of university of maryland bee researcher nathalie steinhauer wednesday june 21 2023 in college park md ap photojulio cortez\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the prognosis is not as bad as 15 years ago because beekeepers have learned how to rebound from big losses she said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“the situation is not really getting worse but it’s also not really getting better” steinhauer said “it is not a bee apocalypse”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "despite big annual losses the situation is a far cry from 2007 when many bee experts expected an end to managed pollination said us department agriculture research entomologist jay evans who wasn’t part of the survey\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“there are threats certainly in the environment and honeybees have persisted” evans said “i don’t think honeybees will go extinct but i think they will always have these sort of challenges”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "some commercial beekeepers who have succeeded in the past lost as much as 80 of their colonies this past year while other beekeepers did well it varied so much evans said pettis who has 150 colonies on maryland’s eastern shore had less than 18 loss saying he used organic acids for mite control\n",

      "parasitic mite varroa are visible on a hive wednesday june 21 2023 in college park md ap photojulio cortez\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the parasitic mite varroa destructor that helps transmit viruses is the chief culprit but bad weather and queen issues were also big problems in the past year steinhauer said pesticides also make things worse because it makes bees more vulnerable to diseases and less likely to seek food she said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“it really can be like death by a thousand cuts with the most obvious one being varroa” steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the mite varroa is a flat creature that crawls on the bee – it would be the equivalent of a frisbee or flat softball on human bodies – evans said the mite seems to make it easier for viruses to attack and kill bees he and steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "it used to take large amounts of varroa such as in 60 of a colony to cause virus problems but now even small infestations at 1 or 2 in a colony can cause massive problems steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“we are fighting this evolving enemy” steinhauer said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "another problem is landscapes that have only one crop or homogenous landscapes which deprive bees of food while pesticides and bouts of extreme weather also have caused problems\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "for example in the washington dc area unusual 80degree warmth in january brought some bees out of their normal winter routine and then when it turned cool again they had problems evans said\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“the impact of climate change on bee colony survival is real and can go undetected” pettis said in an email\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the demand for pollination from commercial bee colonies is growing even as the beekeepers have to work harder to make up for losses steinhauer said the us department of agriculture says 35 of the human diet comes from insectpollinated plants and the honeybee is responsible for 80 of that pollination\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“there is this whole side of our agricultural industry that relies on these colonies” steinhauer said “and the fact that every year the commercial beekeepers have to invest so much more effort to keep those numbers up because they have to fulfill those pollination contracts puts a lot of stress on those beekeepers and the bees” \n",
